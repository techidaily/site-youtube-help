<p>It’s the best time because you will have so many pioneers and successful creators to draw inspiration and knowledge from. You’ll be standing on the shoulders of giants like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and CinnamonToastKen.</p>
<p>The trail has been blazed and you’re in the new frontier. Now, here’s what you need to know about starting a YouTube gaming channel.</p>
<h2 id="1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose"><a href="#1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose" class="headerlink" title="1. Have a Greater Purpose"></a>1. Have a Greater Purpose</h2><p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://tubularinsights.com/15-per-cent-youtube-gaming-videos/" >Tubular Insights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 15% of all content on YouTube is related to video games. That’s a lot.</p>
<p>Additionally, as of 2018, YouTube has a new monetization requirement. To enable monetization, you will need <strong>1,000 subscribers</strong> and <strong>4,000 hours</strong> of watch time in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>If you think you can make a few videos and start making money, I’m sorry, but I’ll have to disappoint you. YouTube is fun and a wonderful way to increase the social aspect of gaming and enhance your enjoyment. Approach it the same way you’ve approached gaming all along, as a fun way to spend your time.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey… and what a journey it can be. Do it for the love of playing games and making videos, and not about getting subscribers or views. If you don’t change your attitude, it’s a grueling climb if all you want is to reach the finish line (which is nowhere in sight).</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this? Well, if you don’t have a greater purpose than simply growing subscribers and making money off YouTube, then you are going to get discouraged and give up. It’s not a get-rich-fast plan.</p>
<p>Here is how you find your greater purpose:</p>
<h4 id="1-Give-Value"><a href="#1-Give-Value" class="headerlink" title="1. Give Value"></a>1. Give Value</h4><p>You want to make good YouTube gaming content like those popular YouTubers that came before you.</p>
<p>But… what makes good YouTube content?</p>
<p>Simply put, good content should exhibit these factors:</p>
<p><strong>Entertaining</strong>: Tell a story and sensationalize the emotions that come out of you when you play games.</p>
<p><strong>Educational</strong>: Find hidden stages, new tricks, and talk about the lore and history that brought this game to life.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring</strong>: Encourage viewers to try new games and play along. Help people discover their next pastime and thank viewers for spending their time with you.</p>
<p> This is what gives your content value, and creating content with value should be your ultimate purpose. Making your viewers feel good is, in a way, better than money, no?</p>
<h4 id="2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual"><a href="#2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual" class="headerlink" title="2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual"></a>2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual</h4><p>YouTube should be a part of your regular schedule.</p>
<p>At first, it’ll be easy. Like anything new, your YouTube channel will have a novelty to it. It’s this exciting new project that you have.</p>
<p>But after the first month, that excitement will dampen. By the third month, it’ll become familiar. Here’s where you have to fight the urge to stop. This is where author, Seth Godin calls <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.ca/dip-Seth-Godin/dp/1591841666" >The Dip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>It’s now working. And like all work, you’ll have to schedule it into your daily life. You’ll have to prioritize YouTube above hanging out with friends, watching another movie, or playing video games without the strain of recording it and being entertaining&#x2F;educating&#x2F;inspiring.</p>
<p>However, if you are getting fulfillment from YouTube, you won’t stop even when the going gets hard. Like being a parent, it’s not always fun, but it should always be fulfilling.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Mark when you are going to be working on YouTube in a calendar, so when someone asks you to hang out or go for dinner, you can check it and let them know you already have plans.</p>
<h4 id="3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step"><a href="#3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step" class="headerlink" title="3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step"></a>3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step</h4><p>There are many stages to producing a YouTube video, from pre-production to production to post-production. And within those stages are countless steps.</p>
<p>If YouTube is what you want to do, perhaps the greatest purpose you can have is improving on each of those skill sets along the way.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you will have a surplus of ideas, but once your initial stock of video ideas run dry, you will need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >practice coming up with more ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get better at recording your gameplay, at speaking on camera, at editing your footage, at optimizing your content, and at sharing your videos.</p>
<p>You will enjoy certain steps more than others, but if you are passionate, you will find comfort in striving to improve in each one, little by little.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>:<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Focus on telling a great story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In every video, you should have an objective you want to accomplish. You want to beat a stage, you want to learn a new skill, etc. Once you nail that, all the other elements (screen recording, editing, and your commentary) will fall into place to guide your story from beginning to end.</p>
<h2 id="2-Create-an-Identity"><a href="#2-Create-an-Identity" class="headerlink" title="2. Create an Identity"></a>2. Create an Identity</h2><p>Your personality and your channel will need to go through a little<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >branding exercise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You need to find what sets yourself apart from all the other gaming channels on the Internet. Ask yourself, and be honest with the answer: Why should anyone care about my channel?</p>
<h4 id="1-Be-Original"><a href="#1-Be-Original" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Original"></a>1. Be Original</h4><p>Take inspiration from other YouTubers and adjust it so that it’s unique. You cannot copy the ideas of popular YouTubers, because the public can see that. They can tell the difference between originality and imitation.</p>
<p>Being original doesn’t mean doing something that has never been done before.</p>
<p>Take a look at Jacksepticeye and Markiplier, both are popular YouTubers recognized for their colorful hair, mass use of profanity, and their Let’s Play style of gaming videos. But if you watch their videos, you can see that they are not copying each other but rather adjusting what has proven to be effective to suit their personality.</p>
<p>If something inspires you and you want to make an original version yourself, don’t think that you need to do something completely different, rather ask, how can I make that awesome thing better?</p>
<h4 id="2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game"><a href="#2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game" class="headerlink" title="2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game"></a>2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game</h4><p>Odds are, you’ll end up playing the same game as other YouTubers. If you’re playing a popular game, then it’s going to be hard for you to establish an audience if your videos are broad.</p>
<p>Consider how your viewers will discover your videos. Are they going to find you through search? If so, what are they searching? There are many aspects to a video game: characters, glitches, stages, etc.</p>
<p>Find a specific aspect of the game to focus on.</p>
<p>Take YouTuber, NoughtPointFourLive, who instead of playing the game via a linear campaign, finds ridiculous situations, odd tricks, and easter eggs in Grand Theft Auto:</p>
<h4 id="3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It"><a href="#3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It" class="headerlink" title="3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It"></a>3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It</h4><p>Every video you make should tell a story. It doesn’t matter if the storyline is the one in the video game or if it’s happening to you in real life. What matters is that you are aware of where the climax is.</p>
<p>The climax is what your story hinges on: it’s when Mario confronts Bowser.</p>
<p>This is what your audience is watching for. They want to know who wins.</p>
<p>To hook your audience right away, open with the most exciting part. The bit leading up to the climax. But don’t give away the ending. You want to hook them. Give a promise that this video is worth watching and that eventually, it will deliver.</p>
<p>Check out this example from YouTuber, Lachlan playing Fortnite and landing back at Spawn Island, an artillery-filled waiting area for players before the game starts.</p>
<p>This structure can be applied with humor as well as climatic events. If you open with something funny, it gets the viewer engaged immediately. They want to know what led up to that humorous moment.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example from YouTuber, Jelly. He does a great job at injecting humor into his first few seconds of video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos"><a href="#3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Gaming Videos"></a>3. Type of Gaming Videos</h2><p>There are no rules to making gaming videos. As long as it’s worth watching and you aren’t stealing content, that is all that matters. Nevertheless, there are a few standard types of gaming videos that have been established over the years.</p>
<h4 id="1-Let’s-Plays"><a href="#1-Let’s-Plays" class="headerlink" title="1. Let’s Plays"></a>1. Let’s Plays</h4><p>Turn the game on and start playing. Let’s Plays give you a lot of freedom to explore the game and let your personality show in the commentary. You don’t need to play with a strategy, but do have a particular goal in mind (Finishing a level, for example).</p>
<p>Let’s Plays are more about watching you experience the game. A demographic of people watching Let’s Plays are those that don’t have the game themselves, but still want to experience it. Let them live vicariously through you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Reviews"><a href="#2-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="2. Reviews"></a>2. Reviews</h4><p>When you’re deciding whether or not to buy a new product where do you go to research? Google and YouTube. If you have a lot of interesting insights after playing a game, making reviews videos might just be your calling. There are many games on the market, and for consumers, it can get overwhelming. Reviews help others decide whether they should invest their money and their time into that specific game or continue searching.</p>
<h4 id="3-Walkthrough"><a href="#3-Walkthrough" class="headerlink" title="3. Walkthrough"></a>3. Walkthrough</h4><p>Unlike Let’s Plays and reviews, walkthrough videos are mapped out and structured to help the viewers pass the game while experiencing events, side quests, and characters they would otherwise have missed.</p>
<h4 id="4-Reactions"><a href="#4-Reactions" class="headerlink" title="4. Reactions"></a>4. Reactions</h4><p>Misery or excitement, when you genuinely react to an event in a game, the audience gets to experience it along your side. Give the moment a bit of lead up, let people know what you are expecting, and then surprise yourself. Reaction videos are great because they are spontaneous and a wonderful form of presenting your personality.</p>
<h4 id="5-Skills"><a href="#5-Skills" class="headerlink" title="5. Skills"></a>5. Skills</h4><p>Video games are hard to master. But if you think you are proficient in an aspect of the game, show off your moves. Is there a particular trick that you can do? Is there a stage you can beat quickly? Are you able to take down your enemy with ease? Prove it.</p>
<h2 id="4-Have-a-Budget"><a href="#4-Have-a-Budget" class="headerlink" title="4. Have a Budget"></a>4. Have a Budget</h2><p>When you begin your YouTube gaming journey, you are going to see a lot of established YouTubers showing off their gear. It’s easy to get carried away with equipment, but we recommend setting a budget and staying within it to start.</p>
<p>What’s a good budget for YouTubers? Some might say you can do it for $600 and others say $3000. That’s a big range.</p>
<p>What you need to ask yourself is what do you currently have.</p>
<p>Are you starting with nothing? Or do you have some essentials? If you have a computer, which can play the game of your choice, you don’t need to spend $2000 on a new one. Look at what you currently have before buying new stuff.</p>
<p>Here is what you will need to get the best results:</p>
<p>- Microphone (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Webcam (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Editing Software (Average cost: $300)</p>
<p>- PC that can handle recording, editing, rendering, uploading, etc. (Average cost: $2,000)</p>
<p>If you are starting out, all you need is a computer with a capable CPU and GPU, a webcam, a microphone, and a free encoding software, such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you will be able to stream.</p>
<p>Even PewDiePie started with a basic gaming setup.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend blowing your life savings on all the equipment you want. Don’t have a powerful computer? There are games such as Minecraft and Roblox that are less taxing to your computer, if you don’t have a powerful one.</p>
<p>There are ways to work around it, if you don’t currently have the funds. Being a YouTuber is all about being resourceful and creative.</p>
<p>You don’t need professional editing software, there are affordable ones such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>that have all the capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="1-Many-Games-Are-Free"><a href="#1-Many-Games-Are-Free" class="headerlink" title="1. Many Games Are Free"></a>1. Many Games Are Free</h4><p>Here’s the great thing about starting as a video game YouTuber, you don’t need to pay for any games. I’m not only talking about the crappy Flash games on the Internet, but massively popular games such as Fortnite and DOTA are also free to start playing as well.</p>
<p>If you’re strapped for cash. Start your channel playing free games and work your way towards more expensive games.</p>
<h4 id="2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well"><a href="#2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well" class="headerlink" title="2. Some Software Are Free As Well"></a>2. Some Software Are Free As Well</h4><p><strong>OBS</strong>: This streaming software allows you to capture your game in top quality and broadcast it directly to YouTube. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >It’s a simple setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it’s completely free.</p>
<p><strong>Audacity</strong>: This audio recording and editing software is great if you want to improve the quality of your audio by removing background noise or combining clips.</p>
<p><strong>GIMP</strong>: Probably the closest free product to Photoshop you can find. GIMP will help you perform basic image manipulation. It’s not as user friendly as Photoshop, but you can learn the fundamentals here as you save up for the Creative Cloud subscription plan.</p>
<h2 id="5-Optimization-Matters"><a href="#5-Optimization-Matters" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimization Matters"></a>5. Optimization Matters</h2><p>Gaming is arguably the most popular genre on YouTube. So, how is your little video going to be discovered in this vast sea of gaming content?</p>
<p>The answer: with a good optimization strategy.</p>
<h4 id="1-Tags-and-Title"><a href="#1-Tags-and-Title" class="headerlink" title="1. Tags and Title"></a>1. Tags and Title</h4><p>When conceptualizing your next video, consider what your viewers are going to search to find it. This will help you focus your gameplay to meet the demand of this untapped (or more specific) audience.</p>
<p>You can use a plugin called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to see the keyword score by simply searching for the content you think your viewers are interested in watching.</p>
<p>If you’re playing Fortnite, and your keyword is simply “Fortnite” you’re using a highly searched term, but the competition is very high as well. The odds of your ranking is incredibly tough as the overall keyword score is 61&#x2F;100.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-1.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>However, if you focus on a more specific aspect of the game to make a video around, such as a character, you can heighten your chance at being discovered.</p>
<p>Take the example below, where I added the keyword “Striker” to the search. Its overall keyword score is 87&#x2F;100, that’s 26 points better in the keyword score, compared to just “Fortnite.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-2.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>This will help you identify the content you should be making and then use that keyword knowledge to write a good title and a list of 5-15 tags.</p>
<p> Few more tips to improving your titles include:</p>
<p>- Avoid uninspiring words like “Fun,” “Exciting,” or “Great.”</p>
<p>- Once you have a title do a quick search to see if it already exists. Common titles make it harder for yours to rank.</p>
<p>- Have the title relate to the game. If there are certain words or phrases that players are familiar with, go ahead and use it.</p>
<p>- Make it click-worthy by promising something unique, but don’t mislead viewers.</p>
<h4 id="2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Awesome Thumbnails"></a>2. Create Awesome Thumbnails</h4><p>It doesn’t matter how awesome your video is, if the thumbnail image is boring, nobody will want to click into it. And if nobody clicks into it, you won’t get any views. Simple.</p>
<p>What makes a good thumbnail image?</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t use the random images YouTube picks for you</li>
<li>Have an expressive picture of a human face (preferably of yours, because it’s your gaming channel and you’re the star)</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a look at The Syndicate Project’s thumbnails and how it evokes an intensity that makes you want to click — or scream with excitement. Both good things.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t want to use your face? Create a character for yourself or to represent your channel. Or used the characters from the actual game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Check out the colorful thumbnails from VanossGaming, where the owl is the mascot of their channel.</p>

                      alt="Create Thumbnail for YouTube Channel"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Use readable text or emojis</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers"><a href="#3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers" class="headerlink" title="3. Engage with Other Gamers"></a>3. Engage with Other Gamers</h4><p>Don’t forget that YouTube is a social media platform.</p>
<p>It’s all about being a part of a YouTube community, and while you can’t interact with every creator on the platform, you can find those within your niche or specific game and chat with them. Leave a comment if you like their video or have constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Additionally, viewer engagements such as likes and comments have shown to have an indirect effect on your video ranking. That is why you should encourage your viewers to “smash” the like button or join in a conversation by asking them a question in your video.</p>
<h2 id="6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization"><a href="#6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization"></a>6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization</h2><h4 id="1-Cause-for-Demonetization"><a href="#1-Cause-for-Demonetization" class="headerlink" title="1. Cause for Demonetization"></a>1. Cause for Demonetization</h4><p>The YouTube monetization landscape has changed a lot for creators in the past few years. The guidelines are always being adjusted to serve both creators and advertisers. If you’re thinking of making money from YouTube ads, you have to be aware that there are types of content that turn advertisers off, and YouTube knows it. Here are some reasons that YouTube will choose to demonetize your videos:</p>
<p>- Excessive or gratuitous violence</p>
<p>- Hateful content: promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates and individual or group of people (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)</p>
<p>- Inappropriate use of family entertainment characters</p>
<p>- Incendiary and demeaning content: disrespectful languages that shame or insult an individual or group</p>
<h4 id="2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike"><a href="#2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoiding Copyright Strike"></a>2. Avoiding Copyright Strike</h4><p>Thanks to the fair use doctrine, you’re allowed to take video game content and make videos from it without acquiring permission from the people who made the game.</p>
<p>However, if you step across the fair use line, you can be penalized for violating copyright infringement.</p>
<p>If you get three strikes from YouTube in 90 days, your account and videos will be removed and you won’t be allowed to create a new channel.</p>
<p>Before you publish your video ask yourself these questions, if you answer yes to any of them then you have met fair use standards:</p>
<p>- Is your content creative or educational?</p>
<p>- Is there more original content than copyrighted content?</p>
<p>- Is your video benefiting the original content?</p>
<p>I recommend that you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube copyright <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how to build your content so that it doesn’t get flagged.</p>
<p>Beyond all that, it’s about playing games, having a good time, and meeting awesome people like yourself. Enjoy the journey and take pleasure in every little achievement, be it in the game or on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><ol>
<li>Don’t go into YouTube gaming for the money, but rather to improve your skills and other people’s lives.</li>
<li>Find something special about your channel that people can’t find anywhere else.</li>
<li>YouTube gaming can be as cheap and as expensive as you want, create a budget to stay within your limits.</li>
<li>Understand optimization to improve your chances of viewers finding your content.</li>
<li>Don’t be hateful or advertisers will avoid you, and don’t steal other people’s content without crediting the original creator.</li>

<p>It’s the best time because you will have so many pioneers and successful creators to draw inspiration and knowledge from. You’ll be standing on the shoulders of giants like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and CinnamonToastKen.</p>
<p>The trail has been blazed and you’re in the new frontier. Now, here’s what you need to know about starting a YouTube gaming channel.</p>
<h2 id="1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose-1"><a href="#1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Have a Greater Purpose"></a>1. Have a Greater Purpose</h2><p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://tubularinsights.com/15-per-cent-youtube-gaming-videos/" >Tubular Insights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 15% of all content on YouTube is related to video games. That’s a lot.</p>
<p>Additionally, as of 2018, YouTube has a new monetization requirement. To enable monetization, you will need <strong>1,000 subscribers</strong> and <strong>4,000 hours</strong> of watch time in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>If you think you can make a few videos and start making money, I’m sorry, but I’ll have to disappoint you. YouTube is fun and a wonderful way to increase the social aspect of gaming and enhance your enjoyment. Approach it the same way you’ve approached gaming all along, as a fun way to spend your time.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey… and what a journey it can be. Do it for the love of playing games and making videos, and not about getting subscribers or views. If you don’t change your attitude, it’s a grueling climb if all you want is to reach the finish line (which is nowhere in sight).</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this? Well, if you don’t have a greater purpose than simply growing subscribers and making money off YouTube, then you are going to get discouraged and give up. It’s not a get-rich-fast plan.</p>
<p>Here is how you find your greater purpose:</p>
<h4 id="1-Give-Value-1"><a href="#1-Give-Value-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Give Value"></a>1. Give Value</h4><p>You want to make good YouTube gaming content like those popular YouTubers that came before you.</p>
<p>But… what makes good YouTube content?</p>
<p>Simply put, good content should exhibit these factors:</p>
<p><strong>Entertaining</strong>: Tell a story and sensationalize the emotions that come out of you when you play games.</p>
<p><strong>Educational</strong>: Find hidden stages, new tricks, and talk about the lore and history that brought this game to life.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring</strong>: Encourage viewers to try new games and play along. Help people discover their next pastime and thank viewers for spending their time with you.</p>
<p> This is what gives your content value, and creating content with value should be your ultimate purpose. Making your viewers feel good is, in a way, better than money, no?</p>
<h4 id="2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual-1"><a href="#2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual"></a>2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual</h4><p>YouTube should be a part of your regular schedule.</p>
<p>At first, it’ll be easy. Like anything new, your YouTube channel will have a novelty to it. It’s this exciting new project that you have.</p>
<p>But after the first month, that excitement will dampen. By the third month, it’ll become familiar. Here’s where you have to fight the urge to stop. This is where author, Seth Godin calls <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.ca/dip-Seth-Godin/dp/1591841666" >The Dip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>It’s now working. And like all work, you’ll have to schedule it into your daily life. You’ll have to prioritize YouTube above hanging out with friends, watching another movie, or playing video games without the strain of recording it and being entertaining&#x2F;educating&#x2F;inspiring.</p>
<p>However, if you are getting fulfillment from YouTube, you won’t stop even when the going gets hard. Like being a parent, it’s not always fun, but it should always be fulfilling.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Mark when you are going to be working on YouTube in a calendar, so when someone asks you to hang out or go for dinner, you can check it and let them know you already have plans.</p>
<h4 id="3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step-1"><a href="#3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step"></a>3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step</h4><p>There are many stages to producing a YouTube video, from pre-production to production to post-production. And within those stages are countless steps.</p>
<p>If YouTube is what you want to do, perhaps the greatest purpose you can have is improving on each of those skill sets along the way.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you will have a surplus of ideas, but once your initial stock of video ideas run dry, you will need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >practice coming up with more ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get better at recording your gameplay, at speaking on camera, at editing your footage, at optimizing your content, and at sharing your videos.</p>
<p>You will enjoy certain steps more than others, but if you are passionate, you will find comfort in striving to improve in each one, little by little.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>:<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Focus on telling a great story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In every video, you should have an objective you want to accomplish. You want to beat a stage, you want to learn a new skill, etc. Once you nail that, all the other elements (screen recording, editing, and your commentary) will fall into place to guide your story from beginning to end.</p>
<h2 id="2-Create-an-Identity-1"><a href="#2-Create-an-Identity-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Create an Identity"></a>2. Create an Identity</h2><p>Your personality and your channel will need to go through a little<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >branding exercise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You need to find what sets yourself apart from all the other gaming channels on the Internet. Ask yourself, and be honest with the answer: Why should anyone care about my channel?</p>
<h4 id="1-Be-Original-1"><a href="#1-Be-Original-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Original"></a>1. Be Original</h4><p>Take inspiration from other YouTubers and adjust it so that it’s unique. You cannot copy the ideas of popular YouTubers, because the public can see that. They can tell the difference between originality and imitation.</p>
<p>Being original doesn’t mean doing something that has never been done before.</p>
<p>Take a look at Jacksepticeye and Markiplier, both are popular YouTubers recognized for their colorful hair, mass use of profanity, and their Let’s Play style of gaming videos. But if you watch their videos, you can see that they are not copying each other but rather adjusting what has proven to be effective to suit their personality.</p>
<p>If something inspires you and you want to make an original version yourself, don’t think that you need to do something completely different, rather ask, how can I make that awesome thing better?</p>
<h4 id="2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game-1"><a href="#2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game"></a>2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game</h4><p>Odds are, you’ll end up playing the same game as other YouTubers. If you’re playing a popular game, then it’s going to be hard for you to establish an audience if your videos are broad.</p>
<p>Consider how your viewers will discover your videos. Are they going to find you through search? If so, what are they searching? There are many aspects to a video game: characters, glitches, stages, etc.</p>
<p>Find a specific aspect of the game to focus on.</p>
<p>Take YouTuber, NoughtPointFourLive, who instead of playing the game via a linear campaign, finds ridiculous situations, odd tricks, and easter eggs in Grand Theft Auto:</p>
<h4 id="3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It-1"><a href="#3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It"></a>3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It</h4><p>Every video you make should tell a story. It doesn’t matter if the storyline is the one in the video game or if it’s happening to you in real life. What matters is that you are aware of where the climax is.</p>
<p>The climax is what your story hinges on: it’s when Mario confronts Bowser.</p>
<p>This is what your audience is watching for. They want to know who wins.</p>
<p>To hook your audience right away, open with the most exciting part. The bit leading up to the climax. But don’t give away the ending. You want to hook them. Give a promise that this video is worth watching and that eventually, it will deliver.</p>
<p>Check out this example from YouTuber, Lachlan playing Fortnite and landing back at Spawn Island, an artillery-filled waiting area for players before the game starts.</p>
<p>This structure can be applied with humor as well as climatic events. If you open with something funny, it gets the viewer engaged immediately. They want to know what led up to that humorous moment.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example from YouTuber, Jelly. He does a great job at injecting humor into his first few seconds of video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos-1"><a href="#3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Gaming Videos"></a>3. Type of Gaming Videos</h2><p>There are no rules to making gaming videos. As long as it’s worth watching and you aren’t stealing content, that is all that matters. Nevertheless, there are a few standard types of gaming videos that have been established over the years.</p>
<h4 id="1-Let’s-Plays-1"><a href="#1-Let’s-Plays-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Let’s Plays"></a>1. Let’s Plays</h4><p>Turn the game on and start playing. Let’s Plays give you a lot of freedom to explore the game and let your personality show in the commentary. You don’t need to play with a strategy, but do have a particular goal in mind (Finishing a level, for example).</p>
<p>Let’s Plays are more about watching you experience the game. A demographic of people watching Let’s Plays are those that don’t have the game themselves, but still want to experience it. Let them live vicariously through you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Reviews-1"><a href="#2-Reviews-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Reviews"></a>2. Reviews</h4><p>When you’re deciding whether or not to buy a new product where do you go to research? Google and YouTube. If you have a lot of interesting insights after playing a game, making reviews videos might just be your calling. There are many games on the market, and for consumers, it can get overwhelming. Reviews help others decide whether they should invest their money and their time into that specific game or continue searching.</p>
<h4 id="3-Walkthrough-1"><a href="#3-Walkthrough-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Walkthrough"></a>3. Walkthrough</h4><p>Unlike Let’s Plays and reviews, walkthrough videos are mapped out and structured to help the viewers pass the game while experiencing events, side quests, and characters they would otherwise have missed.</p>
<h4 id="4-Reactions-1"><a href="#4-Reactions-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Reactions"></a>4. Reactions</h4><p>Misery or excitement, when you genuinely react to an event in a game, the audience gets to experience it along your side. Give the moment a bit of lead up, let people know what you are expecting, and then surprise yourself. Reaction videos are great because they are spontaneous and a wonderful form of presenting your personality.</p>
<h4 id="5-Skills-1"><a href="#5-Skills-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Skills"></a>5. Skills</h4><p>Video games are hard to master. But if you think you are proficient in an aspect of the game, show off your moves. Is there a particular trick that you can do? Is there a stage you can beat quickly? Are you able to take down your enemy with ease? Prove it.</p>
<h2 id="4-Have-a-Budget-1"><a href="#4-Have-a-Budget-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Have a Budget"></a>4. Have a Budget</h2><p>When you begin your YouTube gaming journey, you are going to see a lot of established YouTubers showing off their gear. It’s easy to get carried away with equipment, but we recommend setting a budget and staying within it to start.</p>
<p>What’s a good budget for YouTubers? Some might say you can do it for $600 and others say $3000. That’s a big range.</p>
<p>What you need to ask yourself is what do you currently have.</p>
<p>Are you starting with nothing? Or do you have some essentials? If you have a computer, which can play the game of your choice, you don’t need to spend $2000 on a new one. Look at what you currently have before buying new stuff.</p>
<p>Here is what you will need to get the best results:</p>
<p>- Microphone (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Webcam (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Editing Software (Average cost: $300)</p>
<p>- PC that can handle recording, editing, rendering, uploading, etc. (Average cost: $2,000)</p>
<p>If you are starting out, all you need is a computer with a capable CPU and GPU, a webcam, a microphone, and a free encoding software, such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you will be able to stream.</p>
<p>Even PewDiePie started with a basic gaming setup.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend blowing your life savings on all the equipment you want. Don’t have a powerful computer? There are games such as Minecraft and Roblox that are less taxing to your computer, if you don’t have a powerful one.</p>
<p>There are ways to work around it, if you don’t currently have the funds. Being a YouTuber is all about being resourceful and creative.</p>
<p>You don’t need professional editing software, there are affordable ones such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>that have all the capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="1-Many-Games-Are-Free-1"><a href="#1-Many-Games-Are-Free-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Many Games Are Free"></a>1. Many Games Are Free</h4><p>Here’s the great thing about starting as a video game YouTuber, you don’t need to pay for any games. I’m not only talking about the crappy Flash games on the Internet, but massively popular games such as Fortnite and DOTA are also free to start playing as well.</p>
<p>If you’re strapped for cash. Start your channel playing free games and work your way towards more expensive games.</p>
<h4 id="2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well-1"><a href="#2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Some Software Are Free As Well"></a>2. Some Software Are Free As Well</h4><p><strong>OBS</strong>: This streaming software allows you to capture your game in top quality and broadcast it directly to YouTube. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >It’s a simple setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it’s completely free.</p>
<p><strong>Audacity</strong>: This audio recording and editing software is great if you want to improve the quality of your audio by removing background noise or combining clips.</p>
<p><strong>GIMP</strong>: Probably the closest free product to Photoshop you can find. GIMP will help you perform basic image manipulation. It’s not as user friendly as Photoshop, but you can learn the fundamentals here as you save up for the Creative Cloud subscription plan.</p>
<h2 id="5-Optimization-Matters-1"><a href="#5-Optimization-Matters-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimization Matters"></a>5. Optimization Matters</h2><p>Gaming is arguably the most popular genre on YouTube. So, how is your little video going to be discovered in this vast sea of gaming content?</p>
<p>The answer: with a good optimization strategy.</p>
<h4 id="1-Tags-and-Title-1"><a href="#1-Tags-and-Title-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Tags and Title"></a>1. Tags and Title</h4><p>When conceptualizing your next video, consider what your viewers are going to search to find it. This will help you focus your gameplay to meet the demand of this untapped (or more specific) audience.</p>
<p>You can use a plugin called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to see the keyword score by simply searching for the content you think your viewers are interested in watching.</p>
<p>If you’re playing Fortnite, and your keyword is simply “Fortnite” you’re using a highly searched term, but the competition is very high as well. The odds of your ranking is incredibly tough as the overall keyword score is 61&#x2F;100.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-1.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>However, if you focus on a more specific aspect of the game to make a video around, such as a character, you can heighten your chance at being discovered.</p>
<p>Take the example below, where I added the keyword “Striker” to the search. Its overall keyword score is 87&#x2F;100, that’s 26 points better in the keyword score, compared to just “Fortnite.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-2.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>This will help you identify the content you should be making and then use that keyword knowledge to write a good title and a list of 5-15 tags.</p>
<p> Few more tips to improving your titles include:</p>
<p>- Avoid uninspiring words like “Fun,” “Exciting,” or “Great.”</p>
<p>- Once you have a title do a quick search to see if it already exists. Common titles make it harder for yours to rank.</p>
<p>- Have the title relate to the game. If there are certain words or phrases that players are familiar with, go ahead and use it.</p>
<p>- Make it click-worthy by promising something unique, but don’t mislead viewers.</p>
<h4 id="2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails-1"><a href="#2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Awesome Thumbnails"></a>2. Create Awesome Thumbnails</h4><p>It doesn’t matter how awesome your video is, if the thumbnail image is boring, nobody will want to click into it. And if nobody clicks into it, you won’t get any views. Simple.</p>
<p>What makes a good thumbnail image?</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t use the random images YouTube picks for you</li>
<li>Have an expressive picture of a human face (preferably of yours, because it’s your gaming channel and you’re the star)</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a look at The Syndicate Project’s thumbnails and how it evokes an intensity that makes you want to click — or scream with excitement. Both good things.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-awesome-thumbnail-youtube-gaming-1.jpg"
                      alt="Create Thumbnail for YouTube Channel"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t want to use your face? Create a character for yourself or to represent your channel. Or used the characters from the actual game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Check out the colorful thumbnails from VanossGaming, where the owl is the mascot of their channel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Thumbnail for YouTube Channel"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Use readable text or emojis</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers-1"><a href="#3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Engage with Other Gamers"></a>3. Engage with Other Gamers</h4><p>Don’t forget that YouTube is a social media platform.</p>
<p>It’s all about being a part of a YouTube community, and while you can’t interact with every creator on the platform, you can find those within your niche or specific game and chat with them. Leave a comment if you like their video or have constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Additionally, viewer engagements such as likes and comments have shown to have an indirect effect on your video ranking. That is why you should encourage your viewers to “smash” the like button or join in a conversation by asking them a question in your video.</p>
<h2 id="6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization-1"><a href="#6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization"></a>6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization</h2><h4 id="1-Cause-for-Demonetization-1"><a href="#1-Cause-for-Demonetization-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Cause for Demonetization"></a>1. Cause for Demonetization</h4><p>The YouTube monetization landscape has changed a lot for creators in the past few years. The guidelines are always being adjusted to serve both creators and advertisers. If you’re thinking of making money from YouTube ads, you have to be aware that there are types of content that turn advertisers off, and YouTube knows it. Here are some reasons that YouTube will choose to demonetize your videos:</p>
<p>- Excessive or gratuitous violence</p>
<p>- Hateful content: promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates and individual or group of people (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)</p>
<p>- Inappropriate use of family entertainment characters</p>
<p>- Incendiary and demeaning content: disrespectful languages that shame or insult an individual or group</p>
<h4 id="2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike-1"><a href="#2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoiding Copyright Strike"></a>2. Avoiding Copyright Strike</h4><p>Thanks to the fair use doctrine, you’re allowed to take video game content and make videos from it without acquiring permission from the people who made the game.</p>
<p>However, if you step across the fair use line, you can be penalized for violating copyright infringement.</p>
<p>If you get three strikes from YouTube in 90 days, your account and videos will be removed and you won’t be allowed to create a new channel.</p>
<p>Before you publish your video ask yourself these questions, if you answer yes to any of them then you have met fair use standards:</p>
<p>- Is your content creative or educational?</p>
<p>- Is there more original content than copyrighted content?</p>
<p>- Is your video benefiting the original content?</p>
<p>I recommend that you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube copyright <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how to build your content so that it doesn’t get flagged.</p>
<p>Beyond all that, it’s about playing games, having a good time, and meeting awesome people like yourself. Enjoy the journey and take pleasure in every little achievement, be it in the game or on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-1"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-1" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><ol>

<p>It’s the best time because you will have so many pioneers and successful creators to draw inspiration and knowledge from. You’ll be standing on the shoulders of giants like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and CinnamonToastKen.</p>
<p>The trail has been blazed and you’re in the new frontier. Now, here’s what you need to know about starting a YouTube gaming channel.</p>
<h2 id="1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose-2"><a href="#1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Have a Greater Purpose"></a>1. Have a Greater Purpose</h2><p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://tubularinsights.com/15-per-cent-youtube-gaming-videos/" >Tubular Insights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 15% of all content on YouTube is related to video games. That’s a lot.</p>
<p>Additionally, as of 2018, YouTube has a new monetization requirement. To enable monetization, you will need <strong>1,000 subscribers</strong> and <strong>4,000 hours</strong> of watch time in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>If you think you can make a few videos and start making money, I’m sorry, but I’ll have to disappoint you. YouTube is fun and a wonderful way to increase the social aspect of gaming and enhance your enjoyment. Approach it the same way you’ve approached gaming all along, as a fun way to spend your time.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey… and what a journey it can be. Do it for the love of playing games and making videos, and not about getting subscribers or views. If you don’t change your attitude, it’s a grueling climb if all you want is to reach the finish line (which is nowhere in sight).</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this? Well, if you don’t have a greater purpose than simply growing subscribers and making money off YouTube, then you are going to get discouraged and give up. It’s not a get-rich-fast plan.</p>
<p>Here is how you find your greater purpose:</p>
<h4 id="1-Give-Value-2"><a href="#1-Give-Value-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Give Value"></a>1. Give Value</h4><p>You want to make good YouTube gaming content like those popular YouTubers that came before you.</p>
<p>But… what makes good YouTube content?</p>
<p>Simply put, good content should exhibit these factors:</p>
<p><strong>Entertaining</strong>: Tell a story and sensationalize the emotions that come out of you when you play games.</p>
<p><strong>Educational</strong>: Find hidden stages, new tricks, and talk about the lore and history that brought this game to life.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring</strong>: Encourage viewers to try new games and play along. Help people discover their next pastime and thank viewers for spending their time with you.</p>
<p> This is what gives your content value, and creating content with value should be your ultimate purpose. Making your viewers feel good is, in a way, better than money, no?</p>
<h4 id="2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual-2"><a href="#2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual"></a>2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual</h4><p>YouTube should be a part of your regular schedule.</p>
<p>At first, it’ll be easy. Like anything new, your YouTube channel will have a novelty to it. It’s this exciting new project that you have.</p>
<p>But after the first month, that excitement will dampen. By the third month, it’ll become familiar. Here’s where you have to fight the urge to stop. This is where author, Seth Godin calls <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.ca/dip-Seth-Godin/dp/1591841666" >The Dip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>It’s now working. And like all work, you’ll have to schedule it into your daily life. You’ll have to prioritize YouTube above hanging out with friends, watching another movie, or playing video games without the strain of recording it and being entertaining&#x2F;educating&#x2F;inspiring.</p>
<p>However, if you are getting fulfillment from YouTube, you won’t stop even when the going gets hard. Like being a parent, it’s not always fun, but it should always be fulfilling.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Mark when you are going to be working on YouTube in a calendar, so when someone asks you to hang out or go for dinner, you can check it and let them know you already have plans.</p>
<h4 id="3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step-2"><a href="#3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step"></a>3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step</h4><p>There are many stages to producing a YouTube video, from pre-production to production to post-production. And within those stages are countless steps.</p>
<p>If YouTube is what you want to do, perhaps the greatest purpose you can have is improving on each of those skill sets along the way.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you will have a surplus of ideas, but once your initial stock of video ideas run dry, you will need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >practice coming up with more ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get better at recording your gameplay, at speaking on camera, at editing your footage, at optimizing your content, and at sharing your videos.</p>
<p>You will enjoy certain steps more than others, but if you are passionate, you will find comfort in striving to improve in each one, little by little.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>:<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Focus on telling a great story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In every video, you should have an objective you want to accomplish. You want to beat a stage, you want to learn a new skill, etc. Once you nail that, all the other elements (screen recording, editing, and your commentary) will fall into place to guide your story from beginning to end.</p>
<h2 id="2-Create-an-Identity-2"><a href="#2-Create-an-Identity-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Create an Identity"></a>2. Create an Identity</h2><p>Your personality and your channel will need to go through a little<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >branding exercise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You need to find what sets yourself apart from all the other gaming channels on the Internet. Ask yourself, and be honest with the answer: Why should anyone care about my channel?</p>
<h4 id="1-Be-Original-2"><a href="#1-Be-Original-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Original"></a>1. Be Original</h4><p>Take inspiration from other YouTubers and adjust it so that it’s unique. You cannot copy the ideas of popular YouTubers, because the public can see that. They can tell the difference between originality and imitation.</p>
<p>Being original doesn’t mean doing something that has never been done before.</p>
<p>Take a look at Jacksepticeye and Markiplier, both are popular YouTubers recognized for their colorful hair, mass use of profanity, and their Let’s Play style of gaming videos. But if you watch their videos, you can see that they are not copying each other but rather adjusting what has proven to be effective to suit their personality.</p>
<p>If something inspires you and you want to make an original version yourself, don’t think that you need to do something completely different, rather ask, how can I make that awesome thing better?</p>
<h4 id="2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game-2"><a href="#2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game"></a>2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game</h4><p>Odds are, you’ll end up playing the same game as other YouTubers. If you’re playing a popular game, then it’s going to be hard for you to establish an audience if your videos are broad.</p>
<p>Consider how your viewers will discover your videos. Are they going to find you through search? If so, what are they searching? There are many aspects to a video game: characters, glitches, stages, etc.</p>
<p>Find a specific aspect of the game to focus on.</p>
<p>Take YouTuber, NoughtPointFourLive, who instead of playing the game via a linear campaign, finds ridiculous situations, odd tricks, and easter eggs in Grand Theft Auto:</p>
<h4 id="3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It-2"><a href="#3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It"></a>3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It</h4><p>Every video you make should tell a story. It doesn’t matter if the storyline is the one in the video game or if it’s happening to you in real life. What matters is that you are aware of where the climax is.</p>
<p>The climax is what your story hinges on: it’s when Mario confronts Bowser.</p>
<p>This is what your audience is watching for. They want to know who wins.</p>
<p>To hook your audience right away, open with the most exciting part. The bit leading up to the climax. But don’t give away the ending. You want to hook them. Give a promise that this video is worth watching and that eventually, it will deliver.</p>
<p>Check out this example from YouTuber, Lachlan playing Fortnite and landing back at Spawn Island, an artillery-filled waiting area for players before the game starts.</p>
<p>This structure can be applied with humor as well as climatic events. If you open with something funny, it gets the viewer engaged immediately. They want to know what led up to that humorous moment.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example from YouTuber, Jelly. He does a great job at injecting humor into his first few seconds of video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos-2"><a href="#3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Gaming Videos"></a>3. Type of Gaming Videos</h2><p>There are no rules to making gaming videos. As long as it’s worth watching and you aren’t stealing content, that is all that matters. Nevertheless, there are a few standard types of gaming videos that have been established over the years.</p>
<h4 id="1-Let’s-Plays-2"><a href="#1-Let’s-Plays-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Let’s Plays"></a>1. Let’s Plays</h4><p>Turn the game on and start playing. Let’s Plays give you a lot of freedom to explore the game and let your personality show in the commentary. You don’t need to play with a strategy, but do have a particular goal in mind (Finishing a level, for example).</p>
<p>Let’s Plays are more about watching you experience the game. A demographic of people watching Let’s Plays are those that don’t have the game themselves, but still want to experience it. Let them live vicariously through you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Reviews-2"><a href="#2-Reviews-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Reviews"></a>2. Reviews</h4><p>When you’re deciding whether or not to buy a new product where do you go to research? Google and YouTube. If you have a lot of interesting insights after playing a game, making reviews videos might just be your calling. There are many games on the market, and for consumers, it can get overwhelming. Reviews help others decide whether they should invest their money and their time into that specific game or continue searching.</p>
<h4 id="3-Walkthrough-2"><a href="#3-Walkthrough-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Walkthrough"></a>3. Walkthrough</h4><p>Unlike Let’s Plays and reviews, walkthrough videos are mapped out and structured to help the viewers pass the game while experiencing events, side quests, and characters they would otherwise have missed.</p>
<h4 id="4-Reactions-2"><a href="#4-Reactions-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Reactions"></a>4. Reactions</h4><p>Misery or excitement, when you genuinely react to an event in a game, the audience gets to experience it along your side. Give the moment a bit of lead up, let people know what you are expecting, and then surprise yourself. Reaction videos are great because they are spontaneous and a wonderful form of presenting your personality.</p>
<h4 id="5-Skills-2"><a href="#5-Skills-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Skills"></a>5. Skills</h4><p>Video games are hard to master. But if you think you are proficient in an aspect of the game, show off your moves. Is there a particular trick that you can do? Is there a stage you can beat quickly? Are you able to take down your enemy with ease? Prove it.</p>
<h2 id="4-Have-a-Budget-2"><a href="#4-Have-a-Budget-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Have a Budget"></a>4. Have a Budget</h2><p>When you begin your YouTube gaming journey, you are going to see a lot of established YouTubers showing off their gear. It’s easy to get carried away with equipment, but we recommend setting a budget and staying within it to start.</p>
<p>What’s a good budget for YouTubers? Some might say you can do it for $600 and others say $3000. That’s a big range.</p>
<p>What you need to ask yourself is what do you currently have.</p>
<p>Are you starting with nothing? Or do you have some essentials? If you have a computer, which can play the game of your choice, you don’t need to spend $2000 on a new one. Look at what you currently have before buying new stuff.</p>
<p>Here is what you will need to get the best results:</p>
<p>- Microphone (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Webcam (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Editing Software (Average cost: $300)</p>
<p>- PC that can handle recording, editing, rendering, uploading, etc. (Average cost: $2,000)</p>
<p>If you are starting out, all you need is a computer with a capable CPU and GPU, a webcam, a microphone, and a free encoding software, such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you will be able to stream.</p>
<p>Even PewDiePie started with a basic gaming setup.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend blowing your life savings on all the equipment you want. Don’t have a powerful computer? There are games such as Minecraft and Roblox that are less taxing to your computer, if you don’t have a powerful one.</p>
<p>There are ways to work around it, if you don’t currently have the funds. Being a YouTuber is all about being resourceful and creative.</p>
<p>You don’t need professional editing software, there are affordable ones such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>that have all the capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="1-Many-Games-Are-Free-2"><a href="#1-Many-Games-Are-Free-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Many Games Are Free"></a>1. Many Games Are Free</h4><p>Here’s the great thing about starting as a video game YouTuber, you don’t need to pay for any games. I’m not only talking about the crappy Flash games on the Internet, but massively popular games such as Fortnite and DOTA are also free to start playing as well.</p>
<p>If you’re strapped for cash. Start your channel playing free games and work your way towards more expensive games.</p>
<h4 id="2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well-2"><a href="#2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Some Software Are Free As Well"></a>2. Some Software Are Free As Well</h4><p><strong>OBS</strong>: This streaming software allows you to capture your game in top quality and broadcast it directly to YouTube. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >It’s a simple setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it’s completely free.</p>
<p><strong>Audacity</strong>: This audio recording and editing software is great if you want to improve the quality of your audio by removing background noise or combining clips.</p>
<p><strong>GIMP</strong>: Probably the closest free product to Photoshop you can find. GIMP will help you perform basic image manipulation. It’s not as user friendly as Photoshop, but you can learn the fundamentals here as you save up for the Creative Cloud subscription plan.</p>
<h2 id="5-Optimization-Matters-2"><a href="#5-Optimization-Matters-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimization Matters"></a>5. Optimization Matters</h2><p>Gaming is arguably the most popular genre on YouTube. So, how is your little video going to be discovered in this vast sea of gaming content?</p>
<p>The answer: with a good optimization strategy.</p>
<h4 id="1-Tags-and-Title-2"><a href="#1-Tags-and-Title-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Tags and Title"></a>1. Tags and Title</h4><p>When conceptualizing your next video, consider what your viewers are going to search to find it. This will help you focus your gameplay to meet the demand of this untapped (or more specific) audience.</p>
<p>You can use a plugin called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to see the keyword score by simply searching for the content you think your viewers are interested in watching.</p>
<p>If you’re playing Fortnite, and your keyword is simply “Fortnite” you’re using a highly searched term, but the competition is very high as well. The odds of your ranking is incredibly tough as the overall keyword score is 61&#x2F;100.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-1.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>However, if you focus on a more specific aspect of the game to make a video around, such as a character, you can heighten your chance at being discovered.</p>
<p>Take the example below, where I added the keyword “Striker” to the search. Its overall keyword score is 87&#x2F;100, that’s 26 points better in the keyword score, compared to just “Fortnite.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-2.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>This will help you identify the content you should be making and then use that keyword knowledge to write a good title and a list of 5-15 tags.</p>
<p> Few more tips to improving your titles include:</p>
<p>- Avoid uninspiring words like “Fun,” “Exciting,” or “Great.”</p>
<p>- Once you have a title do a quick search to see if it already exists. Common titles make it harder for yours to rank.</p>
<p>- Have the title relate to the game. If there are certain words or phrases that players are familiar with, go ahead and use it.</p>
<p>- Make it click-worthy by promising something unique, but don’t mislead viewers.</p>
<h4 id="2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails-2"><a href="#2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Awesome Thumbnails"></a>2. Create Awesome Thumbnails</h4><p>It doesn’t matter how awesome your video is, if the thumbnail image is boring, nobody will want to click into it. And if nobody clicks into it, you won’t get any views. Simple.</p>
<p>What makes a good thumbnail image?</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t use the random images YouTube picks for you</li>
<li>Have an expressive picture of a human face (preferably of yours, because it’s your gaming channel and you’re the star)</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a look at The Syndicate Project’s thumbnails and how it evokes an intensity that makes you want to click — or scream with excitement. Both good things.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t want to use your face? Create a character for yourself or to represent your channel. Or used the characters from the actual game.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers-2"><a href="#3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Engage with Other Gamers"></a>3. Engage with Other Gamers</h4><p>Don’t forget that YouTube is a social media platform.</p>
<p>It’s all about being a part of a YouTube community, and while you can’t interact with every creator on the platform, you can find those within your niche or specific game and chat with them. Leave a comment if you like their video or have constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Additionally, viewer engagements such as likes and comments have shown to have an indirect effect on your video ranking. That is why you should encourage your viewers to “smash” the like button or join in a conversation by asking them a question in your video.</p>
<h2 id="6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization-2"><a href="#6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization"></a>6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization</h2><h4 id="1-Cause-for-Demonetization-2"><a href="#1-Cause-for-Demonetization-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Cause for Demonetization"></a>1. Cause for Demonetization</h4><p>The YouTube monetization landscape has changed a lot for creators in the past few years. The guidelines are always being adjusted to serve both creators and advertisers. If you’re thinking of making money from YouTube ads, you have to be aware that there are types of content that turn advertisers off, and YouTube knows it. Here are some reasons that YouTube will choose to demonetize your videos:</p>
<p>- Excessive or gratuitous violence</p>
<p>- Hateful content: promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates and individual or group of people (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)</p>
<p>- Inappropriate use of family entertainment characters</p>
<p>- Incendiary and demeaning content: disrespectful languages that shame or insult an individual or group</p>
<h4 id="2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike-2"><a href="#2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoiding Copyright Strike"></a>2. Avoiding Copyright Strike</h4><p>Thanks to the fair use doctrine, you’re allowed to take video game content and make videos from it without acquiring permission from the people who made the game.</p>
<p>However, if you step across the fair use line, you can be penalized for violating copyright infringement.</p>
<p>If you get three strikes from YouTube in 90 days, your account and videos will be removed and you won’t be allowed to create a new channel.</p>
<p>Before you publish your video ask yourself these questions, if you answer yes to any of them then you have met fair use standards:</p>
<p>- Is your content creative or educational?</p>
<p>- Is there more original content than copyrighted content?</p>
<p>- Is your video benefiting the original content?</p>
<p>I recommend that you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube copyright <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how to build your content so that it doesn’t get flagged.</p>
<p>Beyond all that, it’s about playing games, having a good time, and meeting awesome people like yourself. Enjoy the journey and take pleasure in every little achievement, be it in the game or on YouTube.</p>

<p>It’s the best time because you will have so many pioneers and successful creators to draw inspiration and knowledge from. You’ll be standing on the shoulders of giants like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and CinnamonToastKen.</p>
<p>The trail has been blazed and you’re in the new frontier. Now, here’s what you need to know about starting a YouTube gaming channel.</p>
<h2 id="1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose-3"><a href="#1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Have a Greater Purpose"></a>1. Have a Greater Purpose</h2><p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://tubularinsights.com/15-per-cent-youtube-gaming-videos/" >Tubular Insights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 15% of all content on YouTube is related to video games. That’s a lot.</p>
<p>Additionally, as of 2018, YouTube has a new monetization requirement. To enable monetization, you will need <strong>1,000 subscribers</strong> and <strong>4,000 hours</strong> of watch time in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>If you think you can make a few videos and start making money, I’m sorry, but I’ll have to disappoint you. YouTube is fun and a wonderful way to increase the social aspect of gaming and enhance your enjoyment. Approach it the same way you’ve approached gaming all along, as a fun way to spend your time.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey… and what a journey it can be. Do it for the love of playing games and making videos, and not about getting subscribers or views. If you don’t change your attitude, it’s a grueling climb if all you want is to reach the finish line (which is nowhere in sight).</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this? Well, if you don’t have a greater purpose than simply growing subscribers and making money off YouTube, then you are going to get discouraged and give up. It’s not a get-rich-fast plan.</p>
<p>Here is how you find your greater purpose:</p>
<h4 id="1-Give-Value-3"><a href="#1-Give-Value-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Give Value"></a>1. Give Value</h4><p>You want to make good YouTube gaming content like those popular YouTubers that came before you.</p>
<p>But… what makes good YouTube content?</p>
<p>Simply put, good content should exhibit these factors:</p>
<p><strong>Entertaining</strong>: Tell a story and sensationalize the emotions that come out of you when you play games.</p>
<p><strong>Educational</strong>: Find hidden stages, new tricks, and talk about the lore and history that brought this game to life.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring</strong>: Encourage viewers to try new games and play along. Help people discover their next pastime and thank viewers for spending their time with you.</p>
<p> This is what gives your content value, and creating content with value should be your ultimate purpose. Making your viewers feel good is, in a way, better than money, no?</p>
<h4 id="2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual-3"><a href="#2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual"></a>2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual</h4><p>YouTube should be a part of your regular schedule.</p>
<p>At first, it’ll be easy. Like anything new, your YouTube channel will have a novelty to it. It’s this exciting new project that you have.</p>
<p>But after the first month, that excitement will dampen. By the third month, it’ll become familiar. Here’s where you have to fight the urge to stop. This is where author, Seth Godin calls <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.ca/dip-Seth-Godin/dp/1591841666" >The Dip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>It’s now working. And like all work, you’ll have to schedule it into your daily life. You’ll have to prioritize YouTube above hanging out with friends, watching another movie, or playing video games without the strain of recording it and being entertaining&#x2F;educating&#x2F;inspiring.</p>
<p>However, if you are getting fulfillment from YouTube, you won’t stop even when the going gets hard. Like being a parent, it’s not always fun, but it should always be fulfilling.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Mark when you are going to be working on YouTube in a calendar, so when someone asks you to hang out or go for dinner, you can check it and let them know you already have plans.</p>
<h4 id="3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step-3"><a href="#3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step"></a>3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step</h4><p>There are many stages to producing a YouTube video, from pre-production to production to post-production. And within those stages are countless steps.</p>
<p>If YouTube is what you want to do, perhaps the greatest purpose you can have is improving on each of those skill sets along the way.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you will have a surplus of ideas, but once your initial stock of video ideas run dry, you will need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >practice coming up with more ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get better at recording your gameplay, at speaking on camera, at editing your footage, at optimizing your content, and at sharing your videos.</p>
<p>You will enjoy certain steps more than others, but if you are passionate, you will find comfort in striving to improve in each one, little by little.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>:<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Focus on telling a great story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In every video, you should have an objective you want to accomplish. You want to beat a stage, you want to learn a new skill, etc. Once you nail that, all the other elements (screen recording, editing, and your commentary) will fall into place to guide your story from beginning to end.</p>
<h2 id="2-Create-an-Identity-3"><a href="#2-Create-an-Identity-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Create an Identity"></a>2. Create an Identity</h2><p>Your personality and your channel will need to go through a little<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >branding exercise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You need to find what sets yourself apart from all the other gaming channels on the Internet. Ask yourself, and be honest with the answer: Why should anyone care about my channel?</p>
<h4 id="1-Be-Original-3"><a href="#1-Be-Original-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Original"></a>1. Be Original</h4><p>Take inspiration from other YouTubers and adjust it so that it’s unique. You cannot copy the ideas of popular YouTubers, because the public can see that. They can tell the difference between originality and imitation.</p>
<p>Being original doesn’t mean doing something that has never been done before.</p>
<p>Take a look at Jacksepticeye and Markiplier, both are popular YouTubers recognized for their colorful hair, mass use of profanity, and their Let’s Play style of gaming videos. But if you watch their videos, you can see that they are not copying each other but rather adjusting what has proven to be effective to suit their personality.</p>
<p>If something inspires you and you want to make an original version yourself, don’t think that you need to do something completely different, rather ask, how can I make that awesome thing better?</p>
<h4 id="2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game-3"><a href="#2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game"></a>2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game</h4><p>Odds are, you’ll end up playing the same game as other YouTubers. If you’re playing a popular game, then it’s going to be hard for you to establish an audience if your videos are broad.</p>
<p>Consider how your viewers will discover your videos. Are they going to find you through search? If so, what are they searching? There are many aspects to a video game: characters, glitches, stages, etc.</p>
<p>Find a specific aspect of the game to focus on.</p>
<p>Take YouTuber, NoughtPointFourLive, who instead of playing the game via a linear campaign, finds ridiculous situations, odd tricks, and easter eggs in Grand Theft Auto:</p>
<h4 id="3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It-3"><a href="#3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It"></a>3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It</h4><p>Every video you make should tell a story. It doesn’t matter if the storyline is the one in the video game or if it’s happening to you in real life. What matters is that you are aware of where the climax is.</p>
<p>The climax is what your story hinges on: it’s when Mario confronts Bowser.</p>
<p>This is what your audience is watching for. They want to know who wins.</p>
<p>To hook your audience right away, open with the most exciting part. The bit leading up to the climax. But don’t give away the ending. You want to hook them. Give a promise that this video is worth watching and that eventually, it will deliver.</p>
<p>Check out this example from YouTuber, Lachlan playing Fortnite and landing back at Spawn Island, an artillery-filled waiting area for players before the game starts.</p>
<p>This structure can be applied with humor as well as climatic events. If you open with something funny, it gets the viewer engaged immediately. They want to know what led up to that humorous moment.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example from YouTuber, Jelly. He does a great job at injecting humor into his first few seconds of video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos-3"><a href="#3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Gaming Videos"></a>3. Type of Gaming Videos</h2><p>There are no rules to making gaming videos. As long as it’s worth watching and you aren’t stealing content, that is all that matters. Nevertheless, there are a few standard types of gaming videos that have been established over the years.</p>
<h4 id="1-Let’s-Plays-3"><a href="#1-Let’s-Plays-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Let’s Plays"></a>1. Let’s Plays</h4><p>Turn the game on and start playing. Let’s Plays give you a lot of freedom to explore the game and let your personality show in the commentary. You don’t need to play with a strategy, but do have a particular goal in mind (Finishing a level, for example).</p>
<p>Let’s Plays are more about watching you experience the game. A demographic of people watching Let’s Plays are those that don’t have the game themselves, but still want to experience it. Let them live vicariously through you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Reviews-3"><a href="#2-Reviews-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Reviews"></a>2. Reviews</h4><p>When you’re deciding whether or not to buy a new product where do you go to research? Google and YouTube. If you have a lot of interesting insights after playing a game, making reviews videos might just be your calling. There are many games on the market, and for consumers, it can get overwhelming. Reviews help others decide whether they should invest their money and their time into that specific game or continue searching.</p>
<h4 id="3-Walkthrough-3"><a href="#3-Walkthrough-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Walkthrough"></a>3. Walkthrough</h4><p>Unlike Let’s Plays and reviews, walkthrough videos are mapped out and structured to help the viewers pass the game while experiencing events, side quests, and characters they would otherwise have missed.</p>
<h4 id="4-Reactions-3"><a href="#4-Reactions-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Reactions"></a>4. Reactions</h4><p>Misery or excitement, when you genuinely react to an event in a game, the audience gets to experience it along your side. Give the moment a bit of lead up, let people know what you are expecting, and then surprise yourself. Reaction videos are great because they are spontaneous and a wonderful form of presenting your personality.</p>
<h4 id="5-Skills-3"><a href="#5-Skills-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Skills"></a>5. Skills</h4><p>Video games are hard to master. But if you think you are proficient in an aspect of the game, show off your moves. Is there a particular trick that you can do? Is there a stage you can beat quickly? Are you able to take down your enemy with ease? Prove it.</p>
<h2 id="4-Have-a-Budget-3"><a href="#4-Have-a-Budget-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Have a Budget"></a>4. Have a Budget</h2><p>When you begin your YouTube gaming journey, you are going to see a lot of established YouTubers showing off their gear. It’s easy to get carried away with equipment, but we recommend setting a budget and staying within it to start.</p>
<p>What’s a good budget for YouTubers? Some might say you can do it for $600 and others say $3000. That’s a big range.</p>
<p>What you need to ask yourself is what do you currently have.</p>
<p>Are you starting with nothing? Or do you have some essentials? If you have a computer, which can play the game of your choice, you don’t need to spend $2000 on a new one. Look at what you currently have before buying new stuff.</p>
<p>Here is what you will need to get the best results:</p>
<p>- Microphone (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Webcam (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Editing Software (Average cost: $300)</p>
<p>- PC that can handle recording, editing, rendering, uploading, etc. (Average cost: $2,000)</p>
<p>If you are starting out, all you need is a computer with a capable CPU and GPU, a webcam, a microphone, and a free encoding software, such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you will be able to stream.</p>
<p>Even PewDiePie started with a basic gaming setup.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend blowing your life savings on all the equipment you want. Don’t have a powerful computer? There are games such as Minecraft and Roblox that are less taxing to your computer, if you don’t have a powerful one.</p>
<p>There are ways to work around it, if you don’t currently have the funds. Being a YouTuber is all about being resourceful and creative.</p>
<p>You don’t need professional editing software, there are affordable ones such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>that have all the capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="1-Many-Games-Are-Free-3"><a href="#1-Many-Games-Are-Free-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Many Games Are Free"></a>1. Many Games Are Free</h4><p>Here’s the great thing about starting as a video game YouTuber, you don’t need to pay for any games. I’m not only talking about the crappy Flash games on the Internet, but massively popular games such as Fortnite and DOTA are also free to start playing as well.</p>
<p>If you’re strapped for cash. Start your channel playing free games and work your way towards more expensive games.</p>
<h4 id="2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well-3"><a href="#2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Some Software Are Free As Well"></a>2. Some Software Are Free As Well</h4><p><strong>OBS</strong>: This streaming software allows you to capture your game in top quality and broadcast it directly to YouTube. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >It’s a simple setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it’s completely free.</p>
<p><strong>Audacity</strong>: This audio recording and editing software is great if you want to improve the quality of your audio by removing background noise or combining clips.</p>
<p><strong>GIMP</strong>: Probably the closest free product to Photoshop you can find. GIMP will help you perform basic image manipulation. It’s not as user friendly as Photoshop, but you can learn the fundamentals here as you save up for the Creative Cloud subscription plan.</p>
<h2 id="5-Optimization-Matters-3"><a href="#5-Optimization-Matters-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimization Matters"></a>5. Optimization Matters</h2><p>Gaming is arguably the most popular genre on YouTube. So, how is your little video going to be discovered in this vast sea of gaming content?</p>
<p>The answer: with a good optimization strategy.</p>
<h4 id="1-Tags-and-Title-3"><a href="#1-Tags-and-Title-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Tags and Title"></a>1. Tags and Title</h4><p>When conceptualizing your next video, consider what your viewers are going to search to find it. This will help you focus your gameplay to meet the demand of this untapped (or more specific) audience.</p>
<p>You can use a plugin called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to see the keyword score by simply searching for the content you think your viewers are interested in watching.</p>
<p>If you’re playing Fortnite, and your keyword is simply “Fortnite” you’re using a highly searched term, but the competition is very high as well. The odds of your ranking is incredibly tough as the overall keyword score is 61&#x2F;100.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-1.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>However, if you focus on a more specific aspect of the game to make a video around, such as a character, you can heighten your chance at being discovered.</p>
<p>Take the example below, where I added the keyword “Striker” to the search. Its overall keyword score is 87&#x2F;100, that’s 26 points better in the keyword score, compared to just “Fortnite.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-2.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>This will help you identify the content you should be making and then use that keyword knowledge to write a good title and a list of 5-15 tags.</p>
<p> Few more tips to improving your titles include:</p>
<p>- Avoid uninspiring words like “Fun,” “Exciting,” or “Great.”</p>
<p>- Once you have a title do a quick search to see if it already exists. Common titles make it harder for yours to rank.</p>
<p>- Have the title relate to the game. If there are certain words or phrases that players are familiar with, go ahead and use it.</p>
<p>- Make it click-worthy by promising something unique, but don’t mislead viewers.</p>
<h4 id="2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails-3"><a href="#2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Awesome Thumbnails"></a>2. Create Awesome Thumbnails</h4><p>It doesn’t matter how awesome your video is, if the thumbnail image is boring, nobody will want to click into it. And if nobody clicks into it, you won’t get any views. Simple.</p>
<p>What makes a good thumbnail image?</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t use the random images YouTube picks for you</li>
<li>Have an expressive picture of a human face (preferably of yours, because it’s your gaming channel and you’re the star)</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a look at The Syndicate Project’s thumbnails and how it evokes an intensity that makes you want to click — or scream with excitement. Both good things.</p>

<h4 id="3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers-3"><a href="#3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Engage with Other Gamers"></a>3. Engage with Other Gamers</h4><p>Don’t forget that YouTube is a social media platform.</p>
<p>It’s all about being a part of a YouTube community, and while you can’t interact with every creator on the platform, you can find those within your niche or specific game and chat with them. Leave a comment if you like their video or have constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Additionally, viewer engagements such as likes and comments have shown to have an indirect effect on your video ranking. That is why you should encourage your viewers to “smash” the like button or join in a conversation by asking them a question in your video.</p>
<h2 id="6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization-3"><a href="#6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization</h2><h4 id="1-Cause-for-Demonetization-3"><a href="#1-Cause-for-Demonetization-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Cause for Demonetization"></a>1. Cause for Demonetization</h4><p>The YouTube monetization landscape has changed a lot for creators in the past few years. The guidelines are always being adjusted to serve both creators and advertisers. If you’re thinking of making money from YouTube ads, you have to be aware that there are types of content that turn advertisers off, and YouTube knows it. Here are some reasons that YouTube will choose to demonetize your videos:</p>
<p>- Excessive or gratuitous violence</p>
<p>- Hateful content: promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates and individual or group of people (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)</p>
<p>- Inappropriate use of family entertainment characters</p>
<p>- Incendiary and demeaning content: disrespectful languages that shame or insult an individual or group</p>
<h4 id="2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike-3"><a href="#2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoiding Copyright Strike"></a>2. Avoiding Copyright Strike</h4><p>Thanks to the fair use doctrine, you’re allowed to take video game content and make videos from it without acquiring permission from the people who made the game.</p>
<p>However, if you step across the fair use line, you can be penalized for violating copyright infringement.</p>
<p>If you get three strikes from YouTube in 90 days, your account and videos will be removed and you won’t be allowed to create a new channel.</p>
<p>Before you publish your video ask yourself these questions, if you answer yes to any of them then you have met fair use standards:</p>
<p>- Is your content creative or educational?</p>
<p>- Is there more original content than copyrighted content?</p>
<p>- Is your video benefiting the original content?</p>
<p>I recommend that you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube copyright <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how to build your content so that it doesn’t get flagged.</p>
<p>Beyond all that, it’s about playing games, having a good time, and meeting awesome people like yourself. Enjoy the journey and take pleasure in every little achievement, be it in the game or on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><ol>
<li>Don’t go into YouTube gaming for the money, but rather to improve your skills and other people’s lives.</li>
<li>Find something special about your channel that people can’t find anywhere else.</li>
<li>YouTube gaming can be as cheap and as expensive as you want, create a budget to stay within your limits.</li>
<li>Understand optimization to improve your chances of viewers finding your content.</li>
<li>Don’t be hateful or advertisers will avoid you, and don’t steal other people’s content without crediting the original creator.</li>

<p>YouTube videos have a certain look and feel that many viewers have come to expect and enjoy. Much of the aesthetics of YouTube videos developed as a result of the biggest YouTubers having to quickly and efficiently edit videos together on a daily basis. Below is our list of some of the most common video editing techniques used by famous YouTubers.</p>

Start Big"></a>1. Start Big</h4><p><em>“I’m doing something really exciting… within the first ten seconds of this video. That way you stay here.” – Liza Koshy (How To Be A YouTuber 101!! | Lizzza)</em></p>
<p>In the same way that a teaser or trailer builds anticipation for a full film, many YouTubers start with a preview of the most high-energy part of their video.</p>
<p>In Jake Paul’s prank vlog (above), Jake shows his brother, Logan, chasing and beating him up as Jake screams for help at the top of his lungs. The already high-energy scene is even more intensified by the epic music playing in the background. This seven-second clip, which resurfaces halfway through the video, is enough to entice many viewers to continue watching. It very effectively leaves enough room for viewers to wonder, “How did Logan’s room actually look in the end?” “What was Logan’s initial reaction before he started chasing Jake?” By creating curiosity gaps like these, you can incentivize your viewers to close these gaps by watching longer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Opening-Title-Introduction"><a href="#2-Opening-Title-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="2. Opening Title Introduction"></a>2. Opening Title Introduction</h4><p>Just as TV episodes begin with opening credits and theme music, quite similarly, some YouTubers start their YouTube videos with an intro.</p>
<p>Greg from “How To Drink” has an effective twenty-second intro (above). In this video, he shows you who he is and what his videos are generally about. Since these two things don’t change so much for him from video to video, he can start many of his videos off with this same intro.</p>
<p>Below is a video tutorial about how to add text and titles to video in Filmora, hope that helps you in creating your own YouTube video texts and titles.</p>

<h3 id="Part-2-Cuts"><a href="#Part-2-Cuts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Cuts"></a>Part 2: Cuts</h3><h4 id="1-Jump-Cut"><a href="#1-Jump-Cut" class="headerlink" title="1. Jump Cut"></a>1. Jump Cut</h4><p>A jump cut is a simple and straightforward type of video editing cutting technique that “jumps” from one section of a clip to a later section of a clip, cutting out whatever happened in the middle. Some of the middle parts you might want to remove may include mistakes, long silent pauses, and filler words (umm, like, etc.).</p>
<p>Although the use of jump cuts to remove these parts had been discouraged for a long time in the film world, its extensive use by so many YouTubers has established it as its own style that many viewers have come to expect and enjoy. The jumpiness that comes from jump cuts can be effective in keeping your audience’s attention in a shock-inducing manner.</p>
<p>Jump cuts can also be used to show a passage of time in a creative way or make objects magically appear on-screen.</p>
<p>Zack King (above) makes a toy taxi magically appear in his hands using this video editing technique. Filmora allows you to do jump cut easily, you can watch the tutorial below and learn more <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >jump cut tips and tricks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h4 id="2-Associative-Cut"><a href="#2-Associative-Cut" class="headerlink" title="2. Associative Cut"></a>2. Associative Cut</h4><p>Not everyone in your audience may recognize the cultural or historical references you make in your videos. It can, therefore, be helpful (and also quite enjoyable) to show the original clip of the reference you are making.</p>
<p>In the same vlog that Jake Paul gets chased down by his brother (above), twenty-eight seconds into the video, Jake expresses his desire to go fast in his car. Right after he says “I want to go fast,” Jake cuts into a scene from the movie Talladega Nights. In that scene, Ricky Bobby, Will Ferrell’s character, also says that he wants to go fast.</p>

<h3 id="Part-3-Transform"><a href="#Part-3-Transform" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Transform"></a>Part 3: Transform</h3><h4 id="1-Zoom"><a href="#1-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="1. Zoom"></a>1. Zoom</h4><p>Many YouTubers digitally adjust the zoom of their talking head shots in order to create additional emphasis or suspense. When zoom is used very slowly and smoothly, this technique can be effective in building up suspense and drawing a viewer deeper into the speaker’s message. When a drastic zoom is used suddenly, it can be effective in emphasizing a particular spoken line.</p>
<p>RiceGum is one YouTuber who uses zoom video editing effects extensively in his talking head videos. Want to pan and zoom your video footage too? Check our guide to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >getting Ken Burns Effect on Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p>
<h4 id="2-Camera-Shake"><a href="#2-Camera-Shake" class="headerlink" title="2. Camera Shake"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Camera Shake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Camera shake is a video effect that makes the original clip appear like it was filmed during a violent earthquake. Many YouTubers use this effect to emphasize their voice when they are talking about something erratic or out of control.</p>
<h4 id="3-Color-Level-Adjustment"><a href="#3-Color-Level-Adjustment" class="headerlink" title="3. Color&#x2F;Level Adjustment"></a>3. Color&#x2F;Level Adjustment</h4><p>A lot of comedy YouTubers change the color and levels of their videos in order to emphasize different moods. One common thing YouTubers do when they talk about anything slightly sad is to gradually fade out the colors in their talking head shots. In a cheesy way, the black and white look can emphasize a feeling of emptiness. For his “sad” reactions, PewDiePie often jump cuts into a black and white, slowed down clip of his sad face while playing some sad music in the background. To emphasize a darker message, some YouTubers increase the amount of shadows in their video. In the video below, while his daughter is delivering a darker message from 0:32 to 0:50, La Guardia Cross gradually adds more shadows around his daughter’s face through what appears to be a vignette effect.</p>
<h3 id="Part-4-Transitions"><a href="#Part-4-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Transitions"></a>Part 4: Transitions</h3><h4 id="1-Wipe"><a href="#1-Wipe" class="headerlink" title="1. Wipe"></a>1. Wipe</h4><p>Many YouTubers transition from one scene into the next using a wipe transition. In a wipe transition, the next clip that you want to transition into slides into the frame horizontally or vertically until it completely covers the first clip. For additional wiping effect, many YouTubers also use a fast, high pitched “woosh” sound effect with this transition.</p>
<h4 id="2-Zoom"><a href="#2-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="2. Zoom"></a>2. Zoom</h4><p>The zoom transition is quite similar to the wipe transition, except it uses a zoom effect. Many of the top YouTubers combine this transition with a lower-pitched “woosh” sound effect.</p>
<h3 id="Part-5-Visual-Elements"><a href="#Part-5-Visual-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Visual Elements"></a>Part 5: Visual Elements</h3><p>In other genres of film, the only appropriate visual elements filmmakers can tastefully add to their footage seem to be clean looking, seamlessly integrated text and motion graphics. YouTube, on the other hand, is another world with much more room to get outrageous. Many of the top YouTubers add a lot of visual elements (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >emojis <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, images, filters, explosions) to their videos to emphasize their jokes, play-on-words, historical or cultural references, and mood.</p>
<h4 id="1-Call-To-Action-Visuals"><a href="#1-Call-To-Action-Visuals" class="headerlink" title="1. Call-To-Action Visuals"></a>1. Call-To-Action Visuals</h4><p>Whether they’re prompting you to subscribe, like, comment, or check out their purchasable merchandise, many YouTubers include visuals to strengthen their calls-to-action.</p>
<h3 id="Part-6-Time-Manipulation"><a href="#Part-6-Time-Manipulation" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Time Manipulation"></a>Part 6: Time Manipulation</h3><h4 id="1-Timelapse"><a href="#1-Timelapse" class="headerlink" title="1. Timelapse"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Timelapse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><em>“The staple of any Casey Neistat vlog is the timelapse, which he uses both to further the narrative or set the time of day.” -@omgurheadsgone</em></p>
<p>A lot of cameras now come with a timelapse&#x2F;hyperlapse function, requiring no further video editing. To achieve the kind of timelapses that Casey Neistat makes, though, you’ll have to film real-time footage and then manipulate the speed of it in post. Since sped up ambient sound is hardly ever pleasing to the ear, a lot of YouTubers replace the audio with music that enhances the mood of the timelapse.</p>
<h4 id="2-Slow-Motion"><a href="#2-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="2. Slow Motion"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Slow Motion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Slowing down footage is another way YouTubers like to manipulate the passage of time.

<p>YouTube videos have a certain look and feel that many viewers have come to expect and enjoy. Much of the aesthetics of YouTube videos developed as a result of the biggest YouTubers having to quickly and efficiently edit videos together on a daily basis. Below is our list of some of the most common video editing techniques used by famous YouTubers.</p>

Start Big"></a>1. Start Big</h4><p><em>“I’m doing something really exciting… within the first ten seconds of this video. That way you stay here.” – Liza Koshy (How To Be A YouTuber 101!! | Lizzza)</em></p>
<p>In the same way that a teaser or trailer builds anticipation for a full film, many YouTubers start with a preview of the most high-energy part of their video.</p>
<p>In Jake Paul’s prank vlog (above), Jake shows his brother, Logan, chasing and beating him up as Jake screams for help at the top of his lungs. The already high-energy scene is even more intensified by the epic music playing in the background. This seven-second clip, which resurfaces halfway through the video, is enough to entice many viewers to continue watching. It very effectively leaves enough room for viewers to wonder, “How did Logan’s room actually look in the end?” “What was Logan’s initial reaction before he started chasing Jake?” By creating curiosity gaps like these, you can incentivize your viewers to close these gaps by watching longer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Opening-Title-Introduction-1"><a href="#2-Opening-Title-Introduction-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Opening Title Introduction"></a>2. Opening Title Introduction</h4><p>Just as TV episodes begin with opening credits and theme music, quite similarly, some YouTubers start their YouTube videos with an intro.</p>
<p>Greg from “How To Drink” has an effective twenty-second intro (above). In this video, he shows you who he is and what his videos are generally about. Since these two things don’t change so much for him from video to video, he can start many of his videos off with this same intro.</p>
<p>Below is a video tutorial about how to add text and titles to video in Filmora, hope that helps you in creating your own YouTube video texts and titles.</p>

<h3 id="Part-2-Cuts-1"><a href="#Part-2-Cuts-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Cuts"></a>Part 2: Cuts</h3><h4 id="1-Jump-Cut-1"><a href="#1-Jump-Cut-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Jump Cut"></a>1. Jump Cut</h4><p>A jump cut is a simple and straightforward type of video editing cutting technique that “jumps” from one section of a clip to a later section of a clip, cutting out whatever happened in the middle. Some of the middle parts you might want to remove may include mistakes, long silent pauses, and filler words (umm, like, etc.).</p>
<p>Although the use of jump cuts to remove these parts had been discouraged for a long time in the film world, its extensive use by so many YouTubers has established it as its own style that many viewers have come to expect and enjoy. The jumpiness that comes from jump cuts can be effective in keeping your audience’s attention in a shock-inducing manner.</p>
<p>Jump cuts can also be used to show a passage of time in a creative way or make objects magically appear on-screen.</p>
<p>Zack King (above) makes a toy taxi magically appear in his hands using this video editing technique. Filmora allows you to do jump cut easily, you can watch the tutorial below and learn more <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >jump cut tips and tricks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h4 id="2-Associative-Cut-1"><a href="#2-Associative-Cut-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Associative Cut"></a>2. Associative Cut</h4><p>Not everyone in your audience may recognize the cultural or historical references you make in your videos. It can, therefore, be helpful (and also quite enjoyable) to show the original clip of the reference you are making.</p>
<p>In the same vlog that Jake Paul gets chased down by his brother (above), twenty-eight seconds into the video, Jake expresses his desire to go fast in his car. Right after he says “I want to go fast,” Jake cuts into a scene from the movie Talladega Nights. In that scene, Ricky Bobby, Will Ferrell’s character, also says that he wants to go fast.</p>

<h3 id="Part-3-Transform-1"><a href="#Part-3-Transform-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Transform"></a>Part 3: Transform</h3><h4 id="1-Zoom-1"><a href="#1-Zoom-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Zoom"></a>1. Zoom</h4><p>Many YouTubers digitally adjust the zoom of their talking head shots in order to create additional emphasis or suspense. When zoom is used very slowly and smoothly, this technique can be effective in building up suspense and drawing a viewer deeper into the speaker’s message. When a drastic zoom is used suddenly, it can be effective in emphasizing a particular spoken line.</p>
<p>RiceGum is one YouTuber who uses zoom video editing effects extensively in his talking head videos. Want to pan and zoom your video footage too? Check our guide to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >getting Ken Burns Effect on Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p>
<h4 id="2-Camera-Shake-1"><a href="#2-Camera-Shake-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Camera Shake"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Camera Shake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Camera shake is a video effect that makes the original clip appear like it was filmed during a violent earthquake. Many YouTubers use this effect to emphasize their voice when they are talking about something erratic or out of control.</p>
<h4 id="3-Color-Level-Adjustment-1"><a href="#3-Color-Level-Adjustment-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Color&#x2F;Level Adjustment"></a>3. Color&#x2F;Level Adjustment</h4><p>A lot of comedy YouTubers change the color and levels of their videos in order to emphasize different moods. One common thing YouTubers do when they talk about anything slightly sad is to gradually fade out the colors in their talking head shots. In a cheesy way, the black and white look can emphasize a feeling of emptiness. For his “sad” reactions, PewDiePie often jump cuts into a black and white, slowed down clip of his sad face while playing some sad music in the background. To emphasize a darker message, some YouTubers increase the amount of shadows in their video. In the video below, while his daughter is delivering a darker message from 0:32 to 0:50, La Guardia Cross gradually adds more shadows around his daughter’s face through what appears to be a vignette effect.</p>
<h3 id="Part-4-Transitions-1"><a href="#Part-4-Transitions-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Transitions"></a>Part 4: Transitions</h3><h4 id="1-Wipe-1"><a href="#1-Wipe-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Wipe"></a>1. Wipe</h4><p>Many YouTubers transition from one scene into the next using a wipe transition. In a wipe transition, the next clip that you want to transition into slides into the frame horizontally or vertically until it completely covers the first clip. For additional wiping effect, many YouTubers also use a fast, high pitched “woosh” sound effect with this transition.</p>
<h4 id="2-Zoom-1"><a href="#2-Zoom-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Zoom"></a>2. Zoom</h4><p>The zoom transition is quite similar to the wipe transition, except it uses a zoom effect. Many of the top YouTubers combine this transition with a lower-pitched “woosh” sound effect.</p>
<h3 id="Part-5-Visual-Elements-1"><a href="#Part-5-Visual-Elements-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Visual Elements"></a>Part 5: Visual Elements</h3><p>In other genres of film, the only appropriate visual elements filmmakers can tastefully add to their footage seem to be clean looking, seamlessly integrated text and motion graphics. YouTube, on the other hand, is another world with much more room to get outrageous. Many of the top YouTubers add a lot of visual elements (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >emojis <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, images, filters, explosions) to their videos to emphasize their jokes, play-on-words, historical or cultural references, and mood.</p>
<h4 id="1-Call-To-Action-Visuals-1"><a href="#1-Call-To-Action-Visuals-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Call-To-Action Visuals"></a>1. Call-To-Action Visuals</h4><p>Whether they’re prompting you to subscribe, like, comment, or check out their purchasable merchandise, many YouTubers include visuals to strengthen their calls-to-action.</p>
<h3 id="Part-6-Time-Manipulation-1"><a href="#Part-6-Time-Manipulation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Time Manipulation"></a>Part 6: Time Manipulation</h3><h4 id="1-Timelapse-1"><a href="#1-Timelapse-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Timelapse"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Timelapse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><em>“The staple of any Casey Neistat vlog is the timelapse, which he uses both to further the narrative or set the time of day.” -@omgurheadsgone</em></p>
<p>A lot of cameras now come with a timelapse&#x2F;hyperlapse function, requiring no further video editing. To achieve the kind of timelapses that Casey Neistat makes, though, you’ll have to film real-time footage and then manipulate the speed of it in post. Since sped up ambient sound is hardly ever pleasing to the ear, a lot of YouTubers replace the audio with music that enhances the mood of the timelapse.</p>
<h4 id="2-Slow-Motion-1"><a href="#2-Slow-Motion-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Slow Motion"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Slow Motion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Slowing down footage is another way YouTubers like to manipulate the passage of time. This technique can draw the audience’s attention into the intricacies of a movement captured on film. But if you stretch your video clip digitally in order to achieve this look, your video may not look so smooth – your software will need to create extra frames of footage based on your existing footage. The solution around this problem is to make sure to record your video at a very high frame rate.</p>

<p>YouTube videos have a certain look and feel that many viewers have come to expect and enjoy. Much of the aesthetics of YouTube videos developed as a result of the biggest YouTubers having to quickly and efficiently edit videos together on a daily basis. Below is our list of some of the most common video editing techniques used by famous YouTubers.</p>

Start Big"></a>1. Start Big</h4><p><em>“I’m doing something really exciting… within the first ten seconds of this video. That way you stay here.” – Liza Koshy (How To Be A YouTuber 101!! | Lizzza)</em></p>
<p>In the same way that a teaser or trailer builds anticipation for a full film, many YouTubers start with a preview of the most high-energy part of their video.</p>
<p>In Jake Paul’s prank vlog (above), Jake shows his brother, Logan, chasing and beating him up as Jake screams for help at the top of his lungs. The already high-energy scene is even more intensified by the epic music playing in the background. This seven-second clip, which resurfaces halfway through the video, is enough to entice many viewers to continue watching. It very effectively leaves enough room for viewers to wonder, “How did Logan’s room actually look in the end?” “What was Logan’s initial reaction before he started chasing Jake?” By creating curiosity gaps like these, you can incentivize your viewers to close these gaps by watching longer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Opening-Title-Introduction-2"><a href="#2-Opening-Title-Introduction-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Opening Title Introduction"></a>2. Opening Title Introduction</h4><p>Just as TV episodes begin with opening credits and theme music, quite similarly, some YouTubers start their YouTube videos with an intro.</p>
<p>Greg from “How To Drink” has an effective twenty-second intro (above). In this video, he shows you who he is and what his videos are generally about. Since these two things don’t change so much for him from video to video, he can start many of his videos off with this same intro.</p>
<p>Below is a video tutorial about how to add text and titles to video in Filmora, hope that helps you in creating your own YouTube video texts and titles.</p>

<h3 id="Part-2-Cuts-2"><a href="#Part-2-Cuts-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Cuts"></a>Part 2: Cuts</h3><h4 id="1-Jump-Cut-2"><a href="#1-Jump-Cut-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Jump Cut"></a>1. Jump Cut</h4><p>A jump cut is a simple and straightforward type of video editing cutting technique that “jumps” from one section of a clip to a later section of a clip, cutting out whatever happened in the middle. Some of the middle parts you might want to remove may include mistakes, long silent pauses, and filler words (umm, like, etc.).</p>
<p>Although the use of jump cuts to remove these parts had been discouraged for a long time in the film world, its extensive use by so many YouTubers has established it as its own style that many viewers have come to expect and enjoy. The jumpiness that comes from jump cuts can be effective in keeping your audience’s attention in a shock-inducing manner.</p>
<p>Jump cuts can also be used to show a passage of time in a creative way or make objects magically appear on-screen.</p>
<p>Zack King (above) makes a toy taxi magically appear in his hands using this video editing technique. Filmora allows you to do jump cut easily, you can watch the tutorial below and learn more <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >jump cut tips and tricks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h4 id="2-Associative-Cut-2"><a href="#2-Associative-Cut-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Associative Cut"></a>2. Associative Cut</h4><p>Not everyone in your audience may recognize the cultural or historical references you make in your videos. It can, therefore, be helpful (and also quite enjoyable) to show the original clip of the reference you are making.</p>
<p>In the same vlog that Jake Paul gets chased down by his brother (above), twenty-eight seconds into the video, Jake expresses his desire to go fast in his car. Right after he says “I want to go fast,” Jake cuts into a scene from the movie Talladega Nights. In that scene, Ricky Bobby, Will Ferrell’s character, also says that he wants to go fast.</p>

<h3 id="Part-3-Transform-2"><a href="#Part-3-Transform-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Transform"></a>Part 3: Transform</h3><h4 id="1-Zoom-2"><a href="#1-Zoom-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Zoom"></a>1. Zoom</h4><p>Many YouTubers digitally adjust the zoom of their talking head shots in order to create additional emphasis or suspense. When zoom is used very slowly and smoothly, this technique can be effective in building up suspense and drawing a viewer deeper into the speaker’s message. When a drastic zoom is used suddenly, it can be effective in emphasizing a particular spoken line.</p>
<p>RiceGum is one YouTuber who uses zoom video editing effects extensively in his talking head videos. Want to pan and zoom your video footage too? Check our guide to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >getting Ken Burns Effect on Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p>
<h4 id="2-Camera-Shake-2"><a href="#2-Camera-Shake-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Camera Shake"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Camera Shake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Camera shake is a video effect that makes the original clip appear like it was filmed during a violent earthquake. Many YouTubers use this effect to emphasize their voice when they are talking about something erratic or out of control.</p>
<h4 id="3-Color-Level-Adjustment-2"><a href="#3-Color-Level-Adjustment-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Color&#x2F;Level Adjustment"></a>3. Color&#x2F;Level Adjustment</h4><p>A lot of comedy YouTubers change the color and levels of their videos in order to emphasize different moods. One common thing YouTubers do when they talk about anything slightly sad is to gradually fade out the colors in their talking head shots. In a cheesy way, the black and white look can emphasize a feeling of emptiness. For his “sad” reactions, PewDiePie often jump cuts into a black and white, slowed down clip of his sad face while playing some sad music in the background. To emphasize a darker message, some YouTubers increase the amount of shadows in their video. In the video below, while his daughter is delivering a darker message from 0:32 to 0:50, La Guardia Cross gradually adds more shadows around his daughter’s face through what appears to be a vignette effect.</p>
<h3 id="Part-4-Transitions-2"><a href="#Part-4-Transitions-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Transitions"></a>Part 4: Transitions</h3><h4 id="1-Wipe-2"><a href="#1-Wipe-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Wipe"></a>1. Wipe</h4><p>Many YouTubers transition from one scene into the next using a wipe transition. In a wipe transition, the next clip that you want to transition into slides into the frame horizontally or vertically until it completely covers the first clip. For additional wiping effect, many YouTubers also use a fast, high pitched “woosh” sound effect with this transition.</p>
<h4 id="2-Zoom-2"><a href="#2-Zoom-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Zoom"></a>2. Zoom</h4><p>The zoom transition is quite similar to the wipe transition, except it uses a zoom effect. Many of the top YouTubers combine this transition with a lower-pitched “woosh” sound effect.</p>
<h3 id="Part-5-Visual-Elements-2"><a href="#Part-5-Visual-Elements-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Visual Elements"></a>Part 5: Visual Elements</h3><p>In other genres of film, the only appropriate visual elements filmmakers can tastefully add to their footage seem to be clean looking, seamlessly integrated text and motion graphics. YouTube, on the other hand, is another world with much more room to get outrageous. Many of the top YouTubers add a lot of visual elements (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >emojis <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, images, filters, explosions) to their videos to emphasize their jokes, play-on-words, historical or cultural references, and mood.</p>
<h4 id="1-Call-To-Action-Visuals-2"><a href="#1-Call-To-Action-Visuals-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Call-To-Action Visuals"></a>1. Call-To-Action Visuals</h4><p>Whether they’re prompting you to subscribe, like, comment, or check out their purchasable merchandise, many YouTubers include visuals to strengthen their calls-to-action.</p>
<h3 id="Part-6-Time-Manipulation-2"><a href="#Part-6-Time-Manipulation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Time Manipulation"></a>Part 6: Time Manipulation</h3><h4 id="1-Timelapse-2"><a href="#1-Timelapse-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Timelapse"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Timelapse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><em>“The staple of any Casey Neistat vlog is the timelapse, which he uses both to further the narrative or set the time of day.” -@omgurheadsgone</em></p>
<p>A lot of cameras now come with a timelapse&#x2F;hyperlapse function, requiring no further video editing. To achieve the kind of timelapses that Casey Neistat makes, though, you’ll have to film real-time footage and then manipulate the speed of it in post. Since sped up ambient sound is hardly ever pleasing to the ear, a lot of YouTubers replace the audio with music that enhances the mood of the timelapse.</p>
<h4 id="2-Slow-Motion-2"><a href="#2-Slow-Motion-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Slow Motion"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Slow Motion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Slowing down footage is another way YouTubers like to manipulate the passage of time. This technique can draw the audience’s attention into the intricacies of a movement captured on film. But if you stretch your video clip digitally in order to achieve this look, your video may not look so smooth – your software will need to create extra frames of footage based on your existing footage. The solution around this problem is to make sure to record your video at a very high frame rate.</p>
<p><strong><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hEZfnQRnS4eBO/giphy.gif"
                      alt="Slow Motion"
                ></strong></p>
<h3 id="Part-7-Audio-2"><a href="#Part-7-Audio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Audio"></a>Part 7: Audio</h3><h4 id="1-Censor-2"><a href="#1-Censor-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Censor"></a>1. Censor</h4><p>The traditional practice for censoring out explicit language in television has been to replace profanity with a high pitched <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >“bleep” sound effect <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. YouTubers, however, have popularized the use of animal sound effects to censor out explicit language. Epic Meal Time frequently uses the “caw” of a crow for this purpose.</p>
<h4 id="2-Sound-Effects-2"><a href="#2-Sound-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Sound Effects"></a>2. Sound Effects</h4><p>Whether it is pouring water into a cup or drinking a glass of water, adding louder sound effects can enhance your viewer’s experience of the action that is taking place on camera.</p>
<h4 id="3-Background-Music-2"><a href="#3-Background-Music-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Background Music"></a>3. Background Music</h4><p>Music is very effective in helping people feel all kinds of emotions. It is no wonder so many of the top YouTubers make gratuitous use of music in their videos. Some even <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add background music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to every single clip of their entire YouTube video and only drop the music when the following technique (below) is used.</p>
<h4 id="4-Muting-Background-Music-2"><a href="#4-Muting-Background-Music-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Muting Background Music"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Muting Background Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>A lot of YouTubers who talk over background music abruptly mute the music when they want their audience to focus their attention on whatever it is that they have to say at that very moment. Isolating one’s speech in this way can be a very effective way to emphasize something serious or emphasize a punchline to a joke.</p>
<h4 id="5-Voice-Over-2"><a href="#5-Voice-Over-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Voice-Over"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Voice-Over <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Adding additional recorded verbal commentary is another technique used by many of the top YouTubers. This technique can be helpful when the visuals of your footage do not sufficiently communicate the full message you want to get across to your audience.</p>
<h4 id="6-Compressor-2"><a href="#6-Compressor-2" class="headerlink" title="6.  Compressor"></a>6.  Compressor</h4><p>A lot of video editing software programs give you the option to add compression to your video’s audio. Compression lessens the dynamic range between the softest and loudest parts of your audio. This technique can help your speech sound more uniform in volume.</p>

It can, therefore, be helpful (and also quite enjoyable) to show the original clip of the reference you are making.</p>
<p>In the same vlog that Jake Paul gets chased down by his brother (above), twenty-eight seconds into the video, Jake expresses his desire to go fast in his car. Right after he says “I want to go fast,” Jake cuts into a scene from the movie Talladega Nights. In that scene, Ricky Bobby, Will Ferrell’s character, also says that he wants to go fast.</p>

Zoom"></a>1. Zoom</h4><p>Many YouTubers digitally adjust the zoom of their talking head shots in order to create additional emphasis or suspense. When zoom is used very slowly and smoothly, this technique can be effective in building up suspense and drawing a viewer deeper into the speaker’s message. When a drastic zoom is used suddenly, it can be effective in emphasizing a particular spoken line.</p>
<p>RiceGum is one YouTuber who uses zoom video editing effects extensively in his talking head videos. Want to pan and zoom your video footage too? Check our guide to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >getting Ken Burns Effect on Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p>
<h4 id="2-Camera-Shake-3"><a href="#2-Camera-Shake-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Camera Shake"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Camera Shake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Camera shake is a video effect that makes the original clip appear like it was filmed during a violent earthquake. Many YouTubers use this effect to emphasize their voice when they are talking about something erratic or out of control.</p>
<h4 id="3-Color-Level-Adjustment-3"><a href="#3-Color-Level-Adjustment-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Color&#x2F;Level Adjustment"></a>3. Color&#x2F;Level Adjustment</h4><p>A lot of comedy YouTubers change the color and levels of their videos in order to emphasize different moods. One common thing YouTubers do when they talk about anything slightly sad is to gradually fade out the colors in their talking head shots. In a cheesy way, the black and white look can emphasize a feeling of emptiness. For his “sad” reactions, PewDiePie often jump cuts into a black and white, slowed down clip of his sad face while playing some sad music in the background. To emphasize a darker message, some YouTubers increase the amount of shadows in their video. In the video below, while his daughter is delivering a darker message from 0:32 to 0:50, La Guardia Cross gradually adds more shadows around his daughter’s face through what appears to be a vignette effect.</p>
<h3 id="Part-4-Transitions-3"><a href="#Part-4-Transitions-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Transitions"></a>Part 4: Transitions</h3><h4 id="1-Wipe-3"><a href="#1-Wipe-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Wipe"></a>1. Wipe</h4><p>Many YouTubers transition from one scene into the next using a wipe transition. In a wipe transition, the next clip that you want to transition into slides into the frame horizontally or vertically until it completely covers the first clip. For additional wiping effect, many YouTubers also use a fast, high pitched “woosh” sound effect with this transition.</p>
<h4 id="2-Zoom-3"><a href="#2-Zoom-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Zoom"></a>2. Zoom</h4><p>The zoom transition is quite similar to the wipe transition, except it uses a zoom effect. Many of the top YouTubers combine this transition with a lower-pitched “woosh” sound effect.</p>
<h3 id="Part-5-Visual-Elements-3"><a href="#Part-5-Visual-Elements-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Visual Elements"></a>Part 5: Visual Elements</h3><p>In other genres of film, the only appropriate visual elements filmmakers can tastefully add to their footage seem to be clean looking, seamlessly integrated text and motion graphics. YouTube, on the other hand, is another world with much more room to get outrageous. Many of the top YouTubers add a lot of visual elements (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >emojis <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, images, filters, explosions) to their videos to emphasize their jokes, play-on-words, historical or cultural references, and mood.</p>
<h4 id="1-Call-To-Action-Visuals-3"><a href="#1-Call-To-Action-Visuals-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Call-To-Action Visuals"></a>1. Call-To-Action Visuals</h4><p>Whether they’re prompting you to subscribe, like, comment, or check out their purchasable merchandise, many YouTubers include visuals to strengthen their calls-to-action.</p>
<h3 id="Part-6-Time-Manipulation-3"><a href="#Part-6-Time-Manipulation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Time Manipulation"></a>Part 6: Time Manipulation</h3><h4 id="1-Timelapse-3"><a href="#1-Timelapse-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Timelapse"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Timelapse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><em>“The staple of any Casey Neistat vlog is the timelapse, which he uses both to further the narrative or set the time of day.” -@omgurheadsgone</em></p>
<p>A lot of cameras now come with a timelapse&#x2F;hyperlapse function, requiring no further video editing. To achieve the kind of timelapses that Casey Neistat makes, though, you’ll have to film real-time footage and then manipulate the speed of it in post. Since sped up ambient sound is hardly ever pleasing to the ear, a lot of YouTubers replace the audio with music that enhances the mood of the timelapse.</p>
<h4 id="2-Slow-Motion-3"><a href="#2-Slow-Motion-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Slow Motion"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Slow Motion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Slowing down footage is another way YouTubers like to manipulate the passage of time. This technique can draw the audience’s attention into the intricacies of a movement captured on film. But if you stretch your video clip digitally in order to achieve this look, your video may not look so smooth – your software will need to create extra frames of footage based on your existing footage. The solution around this problem is to make sure to record your video at a very high frame rate.</p>

<h3 id="Part-7-Audio-3"><a href="#Part-7-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Audio"></a>Part 7: Audio</h3><h4 id="1-Censor-3"><a href="#1-Censor-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Censor"></a>1. Censor</h4><p>The traditional practice for censoring out explicit language in television has been to replace profanity with a high pitched <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >“bleep” sound effect <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. YouTubers, however, have popularized the use of animal sound effects to censor out explicit language. Epic Meal Time frequently uses the “caw” of a crow for this purpose.</p>
<h4 id="2-Sound-Effects-3"><a href="#2-Sound-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Sound Effects"></a>2. Sound Effects</h4><p>Whether it is pouring water into a cup or drinking a glass of water, adding louder sound effects can enhance your viewer’s experience of the action that is taking place on camera.</p>
<h4 id="3-Background-Music-3"><a href="#3-Background-Music-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Background Music"></a>3. Background Music</h4><p>Music is very effective in helping people feel all kinds of emotions. It is no wonder so many of the top YouTubers make gratuitous use of music in their videos. Some even <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add background music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to every single clip of their entire YouTube video and only drop the music when the following technique (below) is used.</p>
<h4 id="4-Muting-Background-Music-3"><a href="#4-Muting-Background-Music-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Muting Background Music"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Muting Background Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>A lot of YouTubers who talk over background music abruptly mute the music when they want their audience to focus their attention on whatever it is that they have to say at that very moment. Isolating one’s speech in this way can be a very effective way to emphasize something serious or emphasize a punchline to a joke.</p>
<h4 id="5-Voice-Over-3"><a href="#5-Voice-Over-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Voice-Over"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Voice-Over <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Adding additional recorded verbal commentary is another technique used by many of the top YouTubers. This technique can be helpful when the visuals of your footage do not sufficiently communicate the full message you want to get across to your audience.</p>
<h4 id="6-Compressor-3"><a href="#6-Compressor-3" class="headerlink" title="6.  Compressor"></a>6.  Compressor</h4><p>A lot of video editing software programs give you the option to add compression to your video’s audio. Compression lessens the dynamic range between the softest and loudest parts of your audio. This technique can help your speech sound more uniform in volume.</p>
