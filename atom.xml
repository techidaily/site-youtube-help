Former PayPal employees Chad Hurley, Steven Chen and Jawed Karim founded YouTube in 2005 and only a year later their platform was one of the world’s fastest growing websites, surpassing MySpace with more than 100 million video views in the July of the same year. It wasn’t long before YouTube was purchased by Google on November 13. 2006 and since then the world’s most popular video sharing platform has grown continuously.</p><p>In 2017, more than 500 hours of video content are being uploaded to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> each minute, and over 1.5 billion active users utilize it to share their memories, music they love, business ideas or anything else they feel strongly about. The following infographic will present some of the most interesting YouTube facts and statistics that will enable you to understand better one of the most popular websites ever created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/mind-blowing-youtube-stats-facts-2017.jpg"                      alt="mind blowing youtube stats facts 2017"                ></p><p>It’s hard to pick highlights from such an interesting and comprehensive read, but a couple of key stats shine out.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube has just 0,5 billion users less than Facebook</strong></li></ul><p>Mark Zuckerberg is perhaps one of the best-known business geniuses who made his fortune by creating the social network everyone wanted to be a part of. With more than 2 billion active users Facebook is the largest online community on the Internet today. YouTube has 1.5 billion active monthly users which makes it the second largest platform of its kind, well ahead of Instagram, LinkedIn or Twitter.</p><ul><li><strong>People aged 24 to 44 watch the most videos on YouTube</strong></li></ul><p>This information isn’t particularly surprising since younger generations use the Internet more frequently than the older ones. 49% of all YouTube users are aged between 24 and 44, but this statistic will likely change in the future since YouTube’s popularity can only increase. What comes in as a surprise is the fact that men spend 24% more time on YouTube than women. Could it be that men are more interested in music, short videos or promotional business videos than women or perhaps, women are simply more practical and thus tend to spend less time aimlessly going through endless video content.</p><ul><li><strong>9% of the videos are taken down because of the copyright infringements</strong></li></ul><p>At one point in the early 2000’s, it seemed as if the copyright laws will be changed forever by the Internet. Since then countless initiatives have prevented YouTube users to view, upload or share content that they don’t have the permission to use. In 2017, 9% of all videos uploaded on YouTube are taken down by the copyright holders. This means that YouTubers must make sure that all content they upload is unique or that they at least have a permission to use it.</p><ul><li><strong>An average person spends 40 minutes on YouTube each day</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube is probably one of the best pastimes the Internet can offer, and for that reason, a common person spends 40 minutes on YouTube per day. When you add an average life expectancy into the equation the math shows that during their lifetimes, people spend nearly 2 years on YouTube, or 1 year and 10 months to be exact.</p><ul><li><strong>Pop music singers are the most popular celebrities on YouTube</strong></li></ul><p>Naturally, music is the most searched term on YouTube, and celebrities like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry or Rihana have millions of subscribers with billions of total video views. Unlike Facebook where the most popular celebrities are Christiano Ronaldo or Vin Diesel, an actor and a football player, YouTube stars are mostly musicians and Pop Culture icons whose music is available to fans across the globe because of this platform. Some of the historically most viewed videos on YouTube are Luis Fonsi’s Despacito, Psy’s Gangnam Style or Tayler Swift’s Shake it Off that all have a staggering amount of views.</p><p>Let us know what

A codec is a software or hardware used to compress or decompress digital video.</p><p>If you have limited storage, avoid AVI files because they are non-compressed and occupy large space. Conversely, AVI format stores high-quality videos since they are less compressed.</p><p>Streaming videos from YouTube is expensive.

But, slow down, you have to edit all your clips together first. And then you have to export your video from the editing program, which can take a while. Then you have to wait for it to upload to YouTube, and once it’s up you have to write your description, add cards, and do a handful of other things.</p><p>The period between finishing a video and actually posting it for your subscribers to see can be long and tiresome. A lot of videos have probably died in these stages because their creators ran out of energy and patience.</p><p>Don’t let this happen to your videos! Here are 4 ways you can save time and avoid headaches during post-production:</p><p><a href="#miniproject">1. Create mini-projects</a></p><p><a href="#optimize">2. Optimize your upload speed</a></p><p><a href="#descriptiontags">3. Use default descriptions and tags</a></p><p><a href="#tubebuddy">4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</a></p><h2 id="1-Create-mini-projects"><a href="#1-Create-mini-projects" class="headerlink" title="1. Create mini-projects"></a>1. Create mini-projects</h2><p>When you have a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >large editing project <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with lots of different titles, animations, clip sequences, and PIP tracks it can get hard to keep track of everything. That’s especially true if you need to go back and make changes. A change to one part of your video could affect other parts of it.</p><p>Also, the more complex your video is the longer it will take to render&#x2F;export.</p><p>There is a way you can keep your project more organized, save time making minor adjustments, and speed up rendering: create sub-projects of different segments of your video and import them into your main project as their own clips.</p><p>This helps you in 3 ways:</p><p>1. If there are a lot of effects it’ll be faster to render a shorter video.</p><p>2. If you import your sequence as its own clip you won’t have to worry about adjusting little parts of it whenever you change earlier sections of your video.</p><p>3. If you do want to make adjustments to your sequence you can open up your mini-project and change it without affecting anything in your main project.</p><h2 id="2-Optimize-your-upload-speed"><a href="#2-Optimize-your-upload-speed" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize your upload speed"></a>2. Optimize your upload speed</h2><p>At home, your videos will upload fastest if all of your internet resources are devoted to the upload. That means you should not have any other windows open on your computer while you are uploading. You should also make sure there aren’t other devices competing for wifi like smart tvs, cell phones, or really fancy coffee makers.</p><p>If you have neighbors on the same wifi signal as you and they are online at the same time, this will slow you down too.</p><p>Because there is so much that can interfere with wifi, you might want to consider a wired Ethernet cable. Ethernet connections are faster in general, and you won’t have any problems with other devices competing for resources like you get with wifi.</p><p>If you’re doing everything you can to optimize your upload speed at home and still find that it takes an unreasonable amount of time to upload videos to YouTube, go somewhere with a better connection. Save your video to a USB drive and take it to a library or college to upload. Connections in these kinds of places tend to be very strong.</p><h2 id="3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags"><a href="#3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Use default descriptions and tags"></a>3. Use default descriptions and tags</h2><p>In your <strong>Creator Studio</strong>, go to <strong>Channel &gt; Upload</strong> <strong>defaults</strong>. Here you can write in titles, descriptions, and tags which will automatically be applied to every video you upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-youtube-defaults.jpg"                      alt="Creator Studio Upload Defaults"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139115/17108" target="_top" id="2139115">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139115" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139115/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Note: in the latest YouTube Studio, the upload interface is changed but the main process is similar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Upload video in YouTube Studio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148637/16836" target="_top" id="2148637">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148637" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148637/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You probably have tags you use for almost every video you post. For example, if your channel is about vegan cooking then every one of your videos is probably tagged ‘vegan’, ‘food’, and ‘cooking’. If you type those tags in here then you don’t have to keep adding them to every new video, and you can still add or remove tags from individual uploads so you aren’t stuck using the exact same set of tags every time.</p><p>Similarly, you probably have some default text that goes in the description of every one of your videos (i.e. a link to your personal website or a brief introduction of yourself). If you type in a default description then that text will appear automatically in every new video description and you can just add to it when you need to for individual videos.</p><p>Using defaults might only save you a couple of minutes per video, but those minutes add up.</p><h2 id="4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools"><a href="#4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools" class="headerlink" title="4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools"></a>4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</h2><p>TubeBuddy is a channel management tool for YouTube. Most of its features are more geared towards very large channels or companies with a YouTube presence, but there are also features that can help small or mid-sized YouTubers save time and stay organized.</p><p>Some of these tools include templates for things like cards and end screens and bulk processing tools for when you want to change a lot of things at once. For example, if you wanted to update the links in every card in every one of your videos at once then TubeBuddy could help with that.</p><p>Some of TubeBuddy’s best features for growing channels are the tagging features. TubeBuddy will help you discover tags, suggest new tags, and even copy whole lists of tags from rival videos.</p><p>There are different <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/pricing" >levels of pricing for TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (including a free version, although it’s very limited) and you get a discount on the Pro version if you have less than 50,000 lifetime views on your channel. It ends up being $4.50USD a month (or $3.60 USD a month if you pay for a year in advance). It’s a good investment for someone who’s starting to see some growth on YouTube, but probably not if you’re still trying to reach milestones like 500 subs or 10,000 views.</p><p>You have to work hard to get anywhere on YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you should be toiling away at tedious stuff like typing in the same tags over and over. If you have any time-saving tips then make sure to share them with everyone in the comments!</p><p> <em>Remember that your time is valuable &#x3D;)</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-youtube-in-filmora9.jpg"                      alt="upload video to YouTube inFilmora9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137204/26400" target="_top" id="2137204">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137204" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137204/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you are using Filmora to edit YouTube videos, you can upload the video to YouTube directly from Filmora without download it again first, which can save you time.

You’ve also probably noticed that when you looking for royalty-free music or stock footage a lot of it is licensed through creative commons.</p><p>So, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what exactly are creative commons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</p><p>To hold the copyright to a creative work means that you own it, and anybody who wants to use your work for anything (i.e. uses a song you composed in their YouTube video) has to do so on your terms. When you license your work through creative commons you do not give up your rights to your creative work (a common misconception).</p><p>When you use a creative commons license you are outlining the terms under which other creators are allowed to use your creations in their projects for free if they credit you for your work.</p><p>If you do not want anyone using your work for free in any context, you stick to traditional copyrighting.</p><p>But if you’ve created a piece of music, a photograph, or a clip that you wouldn’t mind other people using, potentially as a way to get your name out there, you might want to consider creative commons.</p><p>There are 6 different creative commons licenses. Which is right for you will depend on your answers to these two questions:</p><p>Are you okay with a creator making money off of something they create using your work?</p><p>Are you okay with a creator producing a derivative of your work?</p><p>To say ‘no derivatives’ is to say ‘I’m okay with people using it, so long as they don’t change it’. One example of a derivative is a techno remix of a song. If you are alright with other creators making derivatives of your work, you may also want to require them to ‘ShareAlike’. ShareAlike means that the creator of that techno remix of your song has to use the same creative commons license you used for your original to distribute the remix.</p><p>An example of a derivative someone might make of a YouTube video would be auto-tuning it to make a song or cutting up your video to make one that’s just ‘the funny parts’.</p><p>Here are the 6 creative commons licenses, and a chart you can use as a quick reference tool.</p><h2 id="Attribution-–-CC-BY"><a href="#Attribution-–-CC-BY" class="headerlink" title="Attribution – CC BY"></a>Attribution – CC BY</h2><p>If you’re using music or other media with this license, all you need to do is credit the artist.</p><p>If you license your video this way, people can do whatever they like with any element of it (video or sound) so long as they credit you. I.e. if someone wanted to mute your clips and use you as stock footage in a bigger project, they could.</p><h2 id="Attribution-ShareAlike-–-CC-BY-SA"><a href="#Attribution-ShareAlike-–-CC-BY-SA" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-ShareAlike – CC BY-SA"></a>Attribution-ShareAlike – CC BY-SA</h2><p>If you use music, photos, or any other media licensed this way, then you must both credit the artist and license your video this same way. Meaning, you can’t use YouTube’s standard license and must instead allow for others to use your work the way you are using the licensed media.</p><p>If you apply this license to your video, you’re saying you don’t mind people using all or portions of your video for their project so long as they allow others to use their work in the same way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896560/19272" target="_top" id="1896560">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896560" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896560/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Attribution-NoDerivs-–-CC-BY-ND"><a href="#Attribution-NoDerivs-–-CC-BY-ND" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-NoDerivs – CC BY-ND"></a>Attribution-NoDerivs – CC BY-ND</h2><p>This one can get tricky.</p><p>Essentially, you can use media licensed this way so long as you don’t alter it or create a different version. For example, you can’t take a song licensed this way and use it in a mashup with another song. That part is clear. Where it gets tricky is when you want to use a song in your video.</p><p>Under normal copyright rules, using a royalty-free song in the background of your video would not count as creating a derivative. The definition of derivative according to creative commons is a bit broader and includes ‘syncing’. This means you can’t take an ‘Attribution-NoDerivs’ song and create any kind of music video for it.</p><p>For example, you can’t edit clips of yourself snowboarding so that they’re in sync with a song that has this license.</p><p>Whether or not you can play the song in the background of your vlog while you are speaking can be a bit of a grey area. In theory, it shouldn’t be a problem, but if you’re accessing the music through a social site like SoundCloud then it might be best to ask the artist first.</p><p>There’s no reason to license your YouTube videos this way. If people cannot alter your video, all that’s left is for them to repost it. Even though they’d also be crediting you, they’d still essentially be stealing views and ad revenue from your original video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144272/7443" target="_top" id="2144272">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144272" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144272/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Attribution-NonCommercial-–-CC-BY-NC"><a href="#Attribution-NonCommercial-–-CC-BY-NC" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-NonCommercial – CC BY-NC"></a>Attribution-NonCommercial – CC BY-NC</h2><p>If you’re using stock footage, music, or stock photos licensed this way then you should still be able to monetize your video. YouTube monetization and commercial use are different things. However, there is a lot of confusion about this issue, and chances are the rights holder intends for this license to mean ‘no monetization’.</p><p>What you definitely could not do with a NonCommercial license is to use the song&#x2F;other media in an actual commercial for a product, including product placement that a brand is paying you for.</p><p>If you license your video this way, people can use it in whatever way they like so long as they credit you and don’t try to make money off of it. Once again, that doesn’t mean they can’t use it in a YouTube video which they monetize because, technically, they’d be making money off of the ad that ran ahead of the video and not the video itself.</p><p>The thing to be careful of with this license is that it’s not ‘ShareAlike’. So, if you license your video this way somebody could use your clips as stock footage and then provide them - as part of their project – for free to a third person to use in a project they were making money off of.</p><h2 id="Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike-–-CC-BY-NC-SA"><a href="#Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike-–-CC-BY-NC-SA" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike – CC BY-NC-SA"></a>Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike – CC BY-NC-SA</h2><p>Music and other media with an ‘Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike’ license can be used in and altered for your videos, so long as you aren’t making money off those videos. You must also use this same license for the video you create using elements licensed this way.</p><p>If you license your video this way, people can use it or a portion of it in their project if they credit you.

But, slow down, you have to edit all your clips together first. And then you have to export your video from the editing program, which can take a while. Then you have to wait for it to upload to YouTube, and once it’s up you have to write your description, add cards, and do a handful of other things.</p><p>The period between finishing a video and actually posting it for your subscribers to see can be long and tiresome. A lot of videos have probably died in these stages because their creators ran out of energy and patience.</p><p>Don’t let this happen to your videos! Here are 4 ways you can save time and avoid headaches during post-production:</p><p><a href="#miniproject">1. Create mini-projects</a></p><p><a href="#optimize">2. Optimize your upload speed</a></p><p><a href="#descriptiontags">3. Use default descriptions and tags</a></p><p><a href="#tubebuddy">4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</a></p><h2 id="1-Create-mini-projects"><a href="#1-Create-mini-projects" class="headerlink" title="1. Create mini-projects"></a>1. Create mini-projects</h2><p>When you have a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >large editing project <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with lots of different titles, animations, clip sequences, and PIP tracks it can get hard to keep track of everything. That’s especially true if you need to go back and make changes. A change to one part of your video could affect other parts of it.</p><p>Also, the more complex your video is the longer it will take to render&#x2F;export.</p><p>There is a way you can keep your project more organized, save time making minor adjustments, and speed up rendering: create sub-projects of different segments of your video and import them into your main project as their own clips.</p><p>This helps you in 3 ways:</p><p>1. If there are a lot of effects it’ll be faster to render a shorter video.</p><p>2. If you import your sequence as its own clip you won’t have to worry about adjusting little parts of it whenever you change earlier sections of your video.</p><p>3. If you do want to make adjustments to your sequence you can open up your mini-project and change it without affecting anything in your main project.</p><h2 id="2-Optimize-your-upload-speed"><a href="#2-Optimize-your-upload-speed" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize your upload speed"></a>2. Optimize your upload speed</h2><p>At home, your videos will upload fastest if all of your internet resources are devoted to the upload. That means you should not have any other windows open on your computer while you are uploading. You should also make sure there aren’t other devices competing for wifi like smart tvs, cell phones, or really fancy coffee makers.</p><p>If you have neighbors on the same wifi signal as you and they are online at the same time, this will slow you down too.</p><p>Because there is so much that can interfere with wifi, you might want to consider a wired Ethernet cable. Ethernet connections are faster in general, and you won’t have any problems with other devices competing for resources like you get with wifi.</p><p>If you’re doing everything you can to optimize your upload speed at home and still find that it takes an unreasonable amount of time to upload videos to YouTube, go somewhere with a better connection. Save your video to a USB drive and take it to a library or college to upload. Connections in these kinds of places tend to be very strong.</p><h2 id="3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags"><a href="#3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Use default descriptions and tags"></a>3. Use default descriptions and tags</h2><p>In your <strong>Creator Studio</strong>, go to <strong>Channel &gt; Upload</strong> <strong>defaults</strong>. Here you can write in titles, descriptions, and tags which will automatically be applied to every video you upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-youtube-defaults.jpg"                      alt="Creator Studio Upload Defaults"                ></p><p>Note: in the latest YouTube Studio, the upload interface is changed but the main process is similar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Upload video in YouTube Studio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977032">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977032">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977032%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977032/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You probably have tags you use for almost every video you post. For example, if your channel is about vegan cooking then every one of your videos is probably tagged ‘vegan’, ‘food’, and ‘cooking’. If you type those tags in here then you don’t have to keep adding them to every new video, and you can still add or remove tags from individual uploads so you aren’t stuck using the exact same set of tags every time.</p><p>Similarly, you probably have some default text that goes in the description of every one of your videos (i.e. a link to your personal website or a brief introduction of yourself). If you type in a default description then that text will appear automatically in every new video description and you can just add to it when you need to for individual videos.</p><p>Using defaults might only save you a couple of minutes per video, but those minutes add up.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135369/19272" target="_top" id="2135369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135369/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools"><a href="#4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools" class="headerlink" title="4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools"></a>4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</h2><p>TubeBuddy is a channel management tool for YouTube. Most of its features are more geared towards very large channels or companies with a YouTube presence, but there are also features that can help small or mid-sized YouTubers save time and stay organized.</p><p>Some of these tools include templates for things like cards and end screens and bulk processing tools for when you want to change a lot of things at once. For example, if you wanted to update the links in every card in every one of your videos at once then TubeBuddy could help with that.</p><p>Some of TubeBuddy’s best features for growing channels are the tagging features. TubeBuddy will help you discover tags, suggest new tags, and even copy whole lists of tags from rival videos.</p><p>There are different <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/pricing" >levels of pricing for TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (including a free version, although it’s very limited) and you get a discount on the Pro version if you have less than 50,000 lifetime views on your channel. It ends up being $4.50USD a month (or $3.60 USD a month if you pay for a year in advance). It’s a good investment for someone who’s starting to see some growth on YouTube, but probably not if you’re still trying to reach milestones like 500 subs or 10,000 views.</p><p>You have to work hard to get anywhere on YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you should be toiling away at tedious stuff like typing in the same tags over and over.

Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic"></a>3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic</h2><p>Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail.

For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.</p><p>Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.</p><h2 id="5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free"><a href="#5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free" class="headerlink" title="5.

You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.</p><p>A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words.

However, the process may take some time, depending on the number of videos in your playlist.</p><p>Although a bit tech-savvy, the script execution method is the most effective way to delete all Watch Later videos at once.</p><p>You can also replace the number at the end of the script with a lower entry to delete videos according to your preference. Also, choosing a lesser number can speed up the video deletion process from YouTube Watch Later list by a great deal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137223/26400" target="_top" id="2137223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137223/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to note that experimenting with scripts is only for some.

So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.</p><p>For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.</p><p>This may take a lot of time.

If your instance of the web browser is outdated, you may experience a <strong>YouTube TV black screen</strong>.</p><p><strong>Incompatible Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>This mostly happens while using Google Chrome. Because Chrome Web Store is populated with a plethora of extensions, it is likely that any of those might become outdated (or get updated), thus becoming incompatible with the current version of the web browser.</p><p><strong>Slow Internet Connection</strong></p><p>This issue could be from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side. At your part, the maximum you can do is, try switching to a wired network, or if you are using Wi-Fi, consider taking your PC or laptop closer to the wireless router.</p><p><strong>Stale DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Every time you visit a website, its DNS (Domain Name System) record is automatically stored in the DNS cache. This helps in the address resolution process (fetching the URL) the next time you open the site. If the DNS information gets stale in the DNS cache, the browser may fail to locate the website, a YouTube video in this case, and you will be displayed with the black screen.</p><p><strong>Outdated Display Driver</strong></p><p>As it is with Windows itself, even the graphic card driver must be updated regularly to maintain your PC’s health. If an updated version of the display driver is not installed on your Windows computer, you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]"></a>Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]</h2><p>Depending on the root cause of the issue, the solutions to fix the <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong> issue may differ. Nevertheless, some of the most effective remedies are discussed below in detail:</p><h3 id="1-Web-Browser-Solution-s"><a href="#1-Web-Browser-Solution-s" class="headerlink" title="1. Web Browser Solution(s)"></a>1. Web Browser Solution(s)</h3><p><strong>Solution 1: Update Your Web Browser</strong></p><p>When you experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, try updating your web browser to its latest version. Assuming that you’re using Google Chrome, the update process is given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome, click the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> icon from the top-right corner, and then select <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> option isn’t available, it simply means that you are already using the latest version of the browser</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Restart the Web Browser</strong></p><p>If the video isn’t visible even after updating Google Chrome, or if you’re already using the most recent version but the issue is still there, you can close the web browser, and relaunch it to see if that helps.</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Use a Different Browser</strong></p><p>If Google Chrome itself is the culprit, the video should be visible on a different browser. You may consider using Mozilla Firefox or the Windows’ default app, Microsoft Edge.</p><p>Copy the URL of the faulty video from Google Chrome’s address bar, and then launch a different web browser, and paste the copied URL in the new browser’s address bar. Press <strong>Enter</strong> and see if the video plays correctly.</p><p><strong>Solution 4: Clean the Web Browser</strong></p><p>Sometimes even the web browser history and caches can also prevent a YouTube video from being displayed. Therefore, it would be a good idea to clear the browser data, and see if it helps. The process is given below:</p><p>After launching the web browser (Google Chrome is used here for example), go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, and then go to <strong>More tools</strong>, and then select <strong>Clear browsing data</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-google-chrome-cache.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome cache"                ></p><p>Switch between the <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> tabs on the <strong>Clear browsing data</strong> box to choose the records that you want to delete, and then choose your preferred duration of the records from the <strong>Time range</strong> drop-down list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-browsing-data-chrome.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome browsing data"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Clear data</strong> from the bottom-right corner to clear browsing caches.</p><p><strong>Solution 5: Disable&#x2F;Remove the Extensions</strong></p><p>If one or more browser extensions are incompatible, even then you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>. In such a case, you can disable those extensions, or permanently remove them to resolve the issue. You can learn the process of doing so by following the instructions that are given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome and go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, go to <strong>More tools,</strong> then select <strong>Extensions</strong> from the submenu that appears.</p><p>Turn off the switch for each of the installed extensions to check if the issue is fixed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-google-chrome-extensions.jpg"                      alt="disable google chrome extension"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If this solution works, you can try enabling the extensions one at a time, and check turning on which one causes <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>. Once the culprit extension is found, you can click <strong>Remove</strong> to get rid of it altogether.</p><p><strong>Solution 6: Reinstall the Browser</strong></p><p>If the video is visible on a different web browser, probably the default one that you are using got corrupted. A quick resolution would be to remove its instance from your PC, and install a fresh copy. To do so:</p><p>• Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the results list.</p><p>• On the <strong>Control Panel</strong> window, click <strong>Uninstall a program</strong> from under the <strong>Programs</strong></p><p>• Click to select the browser from the list of installed apps (Google Chrome here) and select <strong>Uninstall</strong> from above the list.</p><p>• Follow the on-screen instructions from there to remove the web browser from your PC. Next, use Microsoft Edge (or any other browser) to download and install a fresh copy of Google Chrome and see if the issue is fixed</p><h3 id="2-ISP-or-Internet-Speed-Solution-s"><a href="#2-ISP-or-Internet-Speed-Solution-s" class="headerlink" title="2. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)"></a>2. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)</h3><p>If you are experiencing a slow Internet connection, the issue might be either from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side, or on your part. In any case, you can try the following solutions to fix the issue:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Get Your PC&#x2F;Laptop Closer to the Router</strong></p><p>If you are using a Wi-Fi network, consider bringing your device a bit closer to the wireless router and see if the issue is fixed. You may also want to recheck and ensure that there are no highly magnetic devices (a speaker or something similar) placed near the router.</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Switch to a Wired Network</strong></p><p>If the problem persists, try connecting your laptop&#x2F;desktop PC to your router with a LAN cable, and then try reopening the YouTube video to see if it plays correctly this time.</p><p><strong>PC&#x2F;Windows Solution(s)</strong></p><p>At times, your computer could be the main culprit, and trying some basic troubleshooting steps might resolve the issue. Some of the most effective solutions are listed below:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Clear DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Clearing the DNS cache ensures that your PC is now ready to accept and save new DNS records in the cache. The process of clearing the existing cache data is listed below:</p><p>Type <strong>CMD</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and click <strong>Run as administrator</strong> from the right menu of the results list.</p><p>Click <strong>Yes</strong> on the <strong>User Account Control</strong> confirmation box, and in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window, type <strong>IPCONFIG &#x2F;FLUSHDNS</strong> and press Enter</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-command-to-fix-youtube-black-screen.jpg"                      alt="use command to fix YouTube black screen"                ></p><p>Try opening the YouTube video again and see if the issue is fixed</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Update the Graphic Card Driver</strong></p><p>Anything that you see on your computer screen is because of the graphics card. Since a driver is needed to interact with the device, an old one might prevent the videos from getting displayed. If the graphics card is the culprit, the chances are that you won’t be able to see any video at all, be it from YouTube or offline. Therefore, checking if you are using the latest version of the graphic card driver wouldn’t harm you. The process is given below:</p><p>Right-click <strong>Start</strong> and go to <strong>Device Manager</strong> from the context menu</p><p>Expand the <strong>Display adapters</strong> tree on the <strong>Device Manager</strong> snap-in, and right-click the graphics card from the list and select <strong>Update driver</strong> from the context menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upgrade-graphic-card-to-fix-youtube-video-black-screen.jpg"                      alt="upgrade graphic card to fix YouTube black screen"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Search automatically for drivers</strong> from the next screen that appears and follow the on-screen instructions from there to update the graphic card driver.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If your PC has multiple graphic cards installed in it, you will have to follow this procedure for each of them individually.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Troubleshoot-YouTube-Black-Screen-on-Mobile"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Troubleshoot-YouTube-Black-Screen-on-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Mobile?"></a>Part 3: How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Mobile?</h2><p>If you wish to watch online videos on your smartphone, but experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, the process of fixing the issue on the phones is comparatively simple.

If your instance of the web browser is outdated, you may experience a <strong>YouTube TV black screen</strong>.</p><p><strong>Incompatible Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>This mostly happens while using Google Chrome. Because Chrome Web Store is populated with a plethora of extensions, it is likely that any of those might become outdated (or get updated), thus becoming incompatible with the current version of the web browser.</p><p><strong>Slow Internet Connection</strong></p><p>This issue could be from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side. At your part, the maximum you can do is, try switching to a wired network, or if you are using Wi-Fi, consider taking your PC or laptop closer to the wireless router.</p><p><strong>Stale DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Every time you visit a website, its DNS (Domain Name System) record is automatically stored in the DNS cache. This helps in the address resolution process (fetching the URL) the next time you open the site. If the DNS information gets stale in the DNS cache, the browser may fail to locate the website, a YouTube video in this case, and you will be displayed with the black screen.</p><p><strong>Outdated Display Driver</strong></p><p>As it is with Windows itself, even the graphic card driver must be updated regularly to maintain your PC’s health.

Web Browser Solution(s)"></a>1. Web Browser Solution(s)</h3><p><strong>Solution 1: Update Your Web Browser</strong></p><p>When you experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, try updating your web browser to its latest version. Assuming that you’re using Google Chrome, the update process is given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome, click the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> icon from the top-right corner, and then select <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> option isn’t available, it simply means that you are already using the latest version of the browser</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Restart the Web Browser</strong></p><p>If the video isn’t visible even after updating Google Chrome, or if you’re already using the most recent version but the issue is still there, you can close the web browser, and relaunch it to see if that helps.</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Use a Different Browser</strong></p><p>If Google Chrome itself is the culprit, the video should be visible on a different browser. You may consider using Mozilla Firefox or the Windows’ default app, Microsoft Edge.</p><p>Copy the URL of the faulty video from Google Chrome’s address bar, and then launch a different web browser, and paste the copied URL in the new browser’s address bar. Press <strong>Enter</strong> and see if the video plays correctly.</p><p><strong>Solution 4: Clean the Web Browser</strong></p><p>Sometimes even the web browser history and caches can also prevent a YouTube video from being displayed. Therefore, it would be a good idea to clear the browser data, and see if it helps. The process is given below:</p><p>After launching the web browser (Google Chrome is used here for example), go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, and then go to <strong>More tools</strong>, and then select <strong>Clear browsing data</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-google-chrome-cache.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome cache"                ></p><p>Switch between the <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> tabs on the <strong>Clear browsing data</strong> box to choose the records that you want to delete, and then choose your preferred duration of the records from the <strong>Time range</strong> drop-down list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-browsing-data-chrome.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome browsing data"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Clear data</strong> from the bottom-right corner to clear browsing caches.</p><p><strong>Solution 5: Disable&#x2F;Remove the Extensions</strong></p><p>If one or more browser extensions are incompatible, even then you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>. In such a case, you can disable those extensions, or permanently remove them to resolve the issue. You can learn the process of doing so by following the instructions that are given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome and go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, go to <strong>More tools,</strong> then select <strong>Extensions</strong> from the submenu that appears.</p><p>Turn off the switch for each of the installed extensions to check if the issue is fixed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-google-chrome-extensions.jpg"                      alt="disable google chrome extension"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If this solution works, you can try enabling the extensions one at a time, and check turning on which one causes <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>. Once the culprit extension is found, you can click <strong>Remove</strong> to get rid of it altogether.</p><p><strong>Solution 6: Reinstall the Browser</strong></p><p>If the video is visible on a different web browser, probably the default one that you are using got corrupted. A quick resolution would be to remove its instance from your PC, and install a fresh copy. To do so:</p><p>• Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the results list.</p><p>• On the <strong>Control Panel</strong> window, click <strong>Uninstall a program</strong> from under the <strong>Programs</strong></p><p>• Click to select the browser from the list of installed apps (Google Chrome here) and select <strong>Uninstall</strong> from above the list.</p><p>• Follow the on-screen instructions from there to remove the web browser from your PC. Next, use Microsoft Edge (or any other browser) to download and install a fresh copy of Google Chrome and see if the issue is fixed</p><h3 id="2-ISP-or-Internet-Speed-Solution-s-1"><a href="#2-ISP-or-Internet-Speed-Solution-s-1" class="headerlink" title="2. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)"></a>2. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)</h3><p>If you are experiencing a slow Internet connection, the issue might be either from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side, or on your part. In any case, you can try the following solutions to fix the issue:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Get Your PC&#x2F;Laptop Closer to the Router</strong></p><p>If you are using a Wi-Fi network, consider bringing your device a bit closer to the wireless router and see if the issue is fixed. You may also want to recheck and ensure that there are no highly magnetic devices (a speaker or something similar) placed near the router.</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Switch to a Wired Network</strong></p><p>If the problem persists, try connecting your laptop&#x2F;desktop PC to your router with a LAN cable, and then try reopening the YouTube video to see if it plays correctly this time.</p><p><strong>PC&#x2F;Windows Solution(s)</strong></p><p>At times, your computer could be the main culprit, and trying some basic troubleshooting steps might resolve the issue. Some of the most effective solutions are listed below:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Clear DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Clearing the DNS cache ensures that your PC is now ready to accept and save new DNS records in the cache. The process of clearing the existing cache data is listed below:</p><p>Type <strong>CMD</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and click <strong>Run as administrator</strong> from the right menu of the results list.</p><p>Click <strong>Yes</strong> on the <strong>User Account Control</strong> confirmation box, and in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window, type <strong>IPCONFIG &#x2F;FLUSHDNS</strong> and press Enter</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-command-to-fix-youtube-black-screen.jpg"                      alt="use command to fix YouTube black screen"                ></p><p>Try opening the YouTube video again and see if the issue is fixed</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Update the Graphic Card Driver</strong></p><p>Anything that you see on your computer screen is because of the graphics card. Since a driver is needed to interact with the device, an old one might prevent the videos from getting displayed. If the graphics card is the culprit, the chances are that you won’t be able to see any video at all, be it from YouTube or offline. Therefore, checking if you are using the latest version of the graphic card driver wouldn’t harm you. The process is given below:</p><p>Right-click <strong>Start</strong> and go to <strong>Device Manager</strong> from the context menu</p><p>Expand the <strong>Display adapters</strong> tree on the <strong>Device Manager</strong> snap-in, and right-click the graphics card from the list and select <strong>Update driver</strong> from the context menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upgrade-graphic-card-to-fix-youtube-video-black-screen.jpg"                      alt="upgrade graphic card to fix YouTube black screen"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Search automatically for drivers</strong> from the next screen that appears and follow the on-screen instructions from there to update the graphic card driver.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If your PC has multiple graphic cards installed in it, you will have to follow this procedure for each of them individually.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Troubleshoot-YouTube-Black-Screen-on-Mobile-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Troubleshoot-YouTube-Black-Screen-on-Mobile-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Mobile?"></a>Part 3: How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Mobile?</h2><p>If you wish to watch online videos on your smartphone, but experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, the process of fixing the issue on the phones is comparatively simple.

If your instance of the web browser is outdated, you may experience a <strong>YouTube TV black screen</strong>.</p><p><strong>Incompatible Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>This mostly happens while using Google Chrome. Because Chrome Web Store is populated with a plethora of extensions, it is likely that any of those might become outdated (or get updated), thus becoming incompatible with the current version of the web browser.</p><p><strong>Slow Internet Connection</strong></p><p>This issue could be from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side. At your part, the maximum you can do is, try switching to a wired network, or if you are using Wi-Fi, consider taking your PC or laptop closer to the wireless router.</p><p><strong>Stale DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Every time you visit a website, its DNS (Domain Name System) record is automatically stored in the DNS cache. This helps in the address resolution process (fetching the URL) the next time you open the site. If the DNS information gets stale in the DNS cache, the browser may fail to locate the website, a YouTube video in this case, and you will be displayed with the black screen.</p><p><strong>Outdated Display Driver</strong></p><p>As it is with Windows itself, even the graphic card driver must be updated regularly to maintain your PC’s health. If an updated version of the display driver is not installed on your Windows computer, you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]"></a>Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]</h2><p>Depending on the root cause of the issue, the solutions to fix the <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong> issue may differ. Nevertheless, some of the most effective remedies are discussed below in detail:</p><h3 id="1-Web-Browser-Solution-s-3"><a href="#1-Web-Browser-Solution-s-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Web Browser Solution(s)"></a>1. Web Browser Solution(s)</h3><p><strong>Solution 1: Update Your Web Browser</strong></p><p>When you experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, try updating your web browser to its latest version. Assuming that you’re using Google Chrome, the update process is given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome, click the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> icon from the top-right corner, and then select <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> option isn’t available, it simply means that you are already using the latest version of the browser</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Restart the Web Browser</strong></p><p>If the video isn’t visible even after updating Google Chrome, or if you’re already using the most recent version but the issue is still there, you can close the web browser, and relaunch it to see if that helps.</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Use a Different Browser</strong></p><p>If Google Chrome itself is the culprit, the video should be visible on a different browser. You may consider using Mozilla Firefox or the Windows’ default app, Microsoft Edge.</p><p>Copy the URL of the faulty video from Google Chrome’s address bar, and then launch a different web browser, and paste the copied URL in the new browser’s address bar. Press <strong>Enter</strong> and see if the video plays correctly.</p><p><strong>Solution 4: Clean the Web Browser</strong></p><p>Sometimes even the web browser history and caches can also prevent a YouTube video from being displayed. Therefore, it would be a good idea to clear the browser data, and see if it helps. The process is given below:</p><p>After launching the web browser (Google Chrome is used here for example), go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, and then go to <strong>More tools</strong>, and then select <strong>Clear browsing data</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-google-chrome-cache.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome cache"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134248/18498" target="_top" id="2134248">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134248" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134248/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Switch between the <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> tabs on the <strong>Clear browsing data</strong> box to choose the records that you want to delete, and then choose your preferred duration of the records from the <strong>Time range</strong> drop-down list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-browsing-data-chrome.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome browsing data"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Clear data</strong> from the bottom-right corner to clear browsing caches.</p><p><strong>Solution 5: Disable&#x2F;Remove the Extensions</strong></p><p>If one or more browser extensions are incompatible, even then you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>. In such a case, you can disable those extensions, or permanently remove them to resolve the issue. You can learn the process of doing so by following the instructions that are given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome and go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, go to <strong>More tools,</strong> then select <strong>Extensions</strong> from the submenu that appears.</p><p>Turn off the switch for each of the installed extensions to check if the issue is fixed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-google-chrome-extensions.jpg"                      alt="disable google chrome extension"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If this solution works, you can try enabling the extensions one at a time, and check turning on which one causes <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>. Once the culprit extension is found, you can click <strong>Remove</strong> to get rid of it altogether.</p><p><strong>Solution 6: Reinstall the Browser</strong></p><p>If the video is visible on a different web browser, probably the default one that you are using got corrupted. A quick resolution would be to remove its instance from your PC, and install a fresh copy. To do so:</p><p>• Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the results list.</p><p>• On the <strong>Control Panel</strong> window, click <strong>Uninstall a program</strong> from under the <strong>Programs</strong></p><p>• Click to select the browser from the list of installed apps (Google Chrome here) and select <strong>Uninstall</strong> from above the list.</p><p>• Follow the on-screen instructions from there to remove the web browser from your PC.

These sites either cannot really deliver on the time frame they promise or are not providing ‘real’ views. They may be using bots that generate a large number of fake views quickly, which can be dangerous for your channel.</p><p>What you want are high retention views from real humans. Quality services, like the ones listed below, will have real people watch your videos (or at least play them all the way through while they do other things). A good turnaround period for 1 million YouTube views is between 6 and 8 months. A waiting period of a few months is necessary if you want viewer retention.</p><p>Viewer retention means someone is actually watching your video, not just clicking on it and clicking away (which is bad for your search engine ranking). Beware that almost all view buying sites will claim to sell high retention views regardless of if they do or not.</p><p>Trustworthy services often have other services available, such as Social Promotion on other social media platforms or YouTube likes and comments. These will help to encourage more organic views, likes, and comments. Also, if your views go up but you have no likes or comments then that might tip people off that you’ve bought views and while it is not against the rules there is certainly a stigma attached.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that while buying human views is not technically against YouTube’s rules and can be done safely, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying subscribers is more dangerous <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/everything-you-need-to-know--how-to-buy-youtube-views-292.html" >For even more information on buying views, click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098701/14409" target="_top" id="2098701">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098701" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098701/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Where-To-Buy-1-Million-YouTube-Views"><a href="#Where-To-Buy-1-Million-YouTube-Views" class="headerlink" title="Where To Buy 1 Million YouTube Views"></a><strong>Where To Buy 1 Million YouTube Views</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="http://buyviewsreview.com/" >BuyViewsReview <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a site dedicated to helping you avoid scams that can hurt your channel.

They have a reasonable completion time of an average of 3 to 4 months for most orders, and you can stake advantage of the video SEO service for free. According to BuyViewsReview’s test, their customer service is excellent.</p><p>You can buy 1 million YouTube views for $3,497 on Devumi.</p><p> <strong>#2: BuyViews:</strong></p><p>BuyViews is another option when you’re trying to reach 1 million views on YouTube. Offering a 100% money-back guarantee just like Devumi, BuyViews’ average time of completion is slightly lower. With this service, you can also buy likes and comments or take advantage of their social promotion options.</p><p>You can buy 1 million views for $4,000 on BuyViews, which is slightly more than Devumi’s price.</p><p> <strong>#3: FastFollowerz:</strong></p><p>FastFollowersz also offers a 100% money-back guarantee. They are able to deliver on their promises, but they are in the number 3 slot because they are not totally safe – 2&#x2F;5 videos in BuyViewsReviews’ test of this service were taken down by YouTube. It also seems like the views they offer are low retention, which can hurt your channel even if your videos don’t get removed.</p><p>You can buy 1 million YouTube views for $2,800 on FastFollowerz, which is significantly less than the two higher-ranked options.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111981/7443" target="_top" id="2111981">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111981" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111981/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-groupcapture-hd-toolkit-fb-edition/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved GroupCapture HD Toolkit, FB Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-friendly-vr-best-multiplayer-metaverse-delights/"><u>[New] Friendly VR Best Multiplayer Metaverse Delights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-gelatogags-humor-graphics-online/"><u>[New] GelatoGags Humor Graphics Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-navigating-the-world-of-youtube-keywords/"><u>[New] Navigating the World of YouTube Keywords</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-speak-up-enhancing-interactions-with-youtube-viewers/"><u>[New] Speak Up Enhancing Interactions with YouTube Viewers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-essential-guide-to-twitter-video-posting/"><u>[New] The Essential Guide to Twitter Video Posting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/easy-guide-to-motorola-g54-5g-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-by-drfone-android/"><u>Easy Guide to Motorola G54 5G FRP Bypass With Best Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/flawless-online-invitation-crafting-youtube-subscription-buttons-for-2024/"><u>Flawless Online Invitation Crafting YouTube Subscription Buttons for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/flv-video-unification-techniques-for-2024/"><u>FLV Video Unification Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/immediate-mastery-skilled-thumbnails-for-valorants-highlights-for-2024/"><u>Immediate Mastery - Skilled Thumbnails for Valorant's Highlights for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-pixels-to-popularity-crafting-engaging-youtube-thumbnails/"><u>In 2024, From Pixels to Popularity Crafting Engaging YouTube Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-your-sim-pin-code-on-your-xiaomi-mix-fold-3-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-innovative-strategies-for-youtube-video-closures/"><u>In 2024, Innovative Strategies for YouTube Video Closures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-paving-the-way-for-individuality-in-the-digital-age-your-youtube-journey/"><u>In 2024, Paving the Way for Individuality in the Digital Age Your YouTube Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-frequency-of-monetization-on-youtube/"><u>In 2024, The Frequency of Monetization on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/ispoofer-is-not-working-on-vivo-y100-5g-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>iSpoofer is not working On Vivo Y100 5G?

And, in this digitally oriented world, you’re left with no reason not to create a YouTube channel specifically when you have the right talent to use one. Well, this guide is for those who are already into YouTube video creation and now need help on how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong> as per different aspect ratios. According to YouTube’s aspect ratio, it’s the right place to move forward even if you want to resize your videos present on other social media apps. We know brands and other influencers generally practice this kind of social media marketing.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our session on resizing YouTube as per the ideal aspect ratio without further ado.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?</h2><p>For attracting more audience and increasing engagement on YouTube videos, you have to look at each factor, along with the YouTube video quality. And, you cannot overlook the size of YouTube video among these factors to make it your perfect shot among competitors. Considering the importance of such factors, we’ve come up with this specific section on introducing you to the correct aspect ratio for YouTube videos.</p><p>It’s crucial to know the size before you start the YouTube game!</p><p>YouTube allows you to upload videos of different sizes ranging from 240p to 8K. And, the dimensions for these different sizes are as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>240p:</strong> 426x240 pixels</li><li><strong>360p:</strong> 640x360 pixels</li><li><strong>480p:</strong> 854x480 pixels</li><li><strong>720p:</strong> 1280x720 pixels</li><li><strong>1080p:</strong> 1920x1080 pixels</li><li><strong>1440p:</strong> 2560x1440 pixels</li><li><strong>2160p:</strong> 3840x2160 pixels</li><li><strong>43200p:</strong> 7680×4320 pixels</li></ul><p>Along with these, the aspect ratio, video size, and length of YouTube video should also be taken into consideration while uploading YouTube videos.</p><p>Thus, the ideal aspect ratio to <strong>resize YouTube video</strong> is perfect as 16:9, which we’ll diversify in the following three sections.</p><p><strong>1. Computer</strong></p><p>On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for YouTube video is 16:9. And, the YouTube player will automatically adjust other aspect ratios than the standard size. For instance, it may add padding of white or gray color depending upon the theme. However, it’s advisable to avoid these things like padding as they interfere with YouTube’s dynamic adjustments.</p><p><strong>2. Android Phone</strong></p><p>In the Android application, the scenario is quite different from YouTube videos. The app automatically adjusts the player as per the video size. The video will always fit the screen, whether it’s square, vertical, or horizontal. Ultimately, the videos will be shorter for widescreen and square for vertical.</p><p><strong>3. iPad &amp; iPhone</strong></p><p>Similarly, the YouTube app for iPad and iPhone automatically adjust the video size to fit the screen. Thus, every video will fit the screen, even if it’s square, horizontal, or vertical.</p><p>Before we let you know how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong>, here are some tips for creating awesome YouTube videos.</p><ul><li>Create a strategy for YouTube video beforehand.</li><li>Search for ideas and topics.</li><li>Understand the use of the best equipment and gear.</li><li>Ensure the best YouTube video editing.</li><li>Optimize YouTube videos.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac"></a>Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac</h2><p>Hopefully, you have noted the correct aspect ratio required for YouTube videos.

And, in this digitally oriented world, you’re left with no reason not to create a YouTube channel specifically when you have the right talent to use one. Well, this guide is for those who are already into YouTube video creation and now need help on how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong> as per different aspect ratios. According to YouTube’s aspect ratio, it’s the right place to move forward even if you want to resize your videos present on other social media apps. We know brands and other influencers generally practice this kind of social media marketing.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our session on resizing YouTube as per the ideal aspect ratio without further ado.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?</h2><p>For attracting more audience and increasing engagement on YouTube videos, you have to look at each factor, along with the YouTube video quality. And, you cannot overlook the size of YouTube video among these factors to make it your perfect shot among competitors. Considering the importance of such factors, we’ve come up with this specific section on introducing you to the correct aspect ratio for YouTube videos.</p><p>It’s crucial to know the size before you start the YouTube game!</p><p>YouTube allows you to upload videos of different sizes ranging from 240p to 8K. And, the dimensions for these different sizes are as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>240p:</strong> 426x240 pixels</li><li><strong>360p:</strong> 640x360 pixels</li><li><strong>480p:</strong> 854x480 pixels</li><li><strong>720p:</strong> 1280x720 pixels</li><li><strong>1080p:</strong> 1920x1080 pixels</li><li><strong>1440p:</strong> 2560x1440 pixels</li><li><strong>2160p:</strong> 3840x2160 pixels</li><li><strong>43200p:</strong> 7680×4320 pixels</li></ul><p>Along with these, the aspect ratio, video size, and length of YouTube video should also be taken into consideration while uploading YouTube videos.</p><p>Thus, the ideal aspect ratio to <strong>resize YouTube video</strong> is perfect as 16:9, which we’ll diversify in the following three sections.</p><p><strong>1. Computer</strong></p><p>On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for YouTube video is 16:9. And, the YouTube player will automatically adjust other aspect ratios than the standard size. For instance, it may add padding of white or gray color depending upon the theme. However, it’s advisable to avoid these things like padding as they interfere with YouTube’s dynamic adjustments.</p><p><strong>2. Android Phone</strong></p><p>In the Android application, the scenario is quite different from YouTube videos. The app automatically adjusts the player as per the video size. The video will always fit the screen, whether it’s square, vertical, or horizontal. Ultimately, the videos will be shorter for widescreen and square for vertical.</p><p><strong>3. iPad &amp; iPhone</strong></p><p>Similarly, the YouTube app for iPad and iPhone automatically adjust the video size to fit the screen. Thus, every video will fit the screen, even if it’s square, horizontal, or vertical.</p><p>Before we let you know how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong>, here are some tips for creating awesome YouTube videos.</p><ul><li>Create a strategy for YouTube video beforehand.</li><li>Search for ideas and topics.</li><li>Understand the use of the best equipment and gear.</li><li>Ensure the best YouTube video editing.</li><li>Optimize YouTube videos.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac-3"><a href="#Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac"></a>Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac</h2><p>Hopefully, you have noted the correct aspect ratio required for YouTube videos.

This process typically follows a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Background Selection:</li></ul><p>A solid, single-color background, often green or blue, that contrasts well with the subject must be used. The color chosen should not be present in the subject or any props in the camera field to avoid unintentional transparency.</p><ul><li>Color Keying:</li></ul><p>This requires the use of specialized visual effects software to key out the chosen color. The green or blue background is designated as transparent, making everything of that color see-through. The software distinguishes between the keyed color and the subject, creating a mask for the transparent areas.</p><ul><li>Foreground Filming:</li></ul><p>This involves filming the subject against the <strong>live chroma key background</strong>. During filming, the chosen background color (green or blue) won’t appear in the final result due to its transparency. The subject is captured as if separately from the isolated background.</p><ul><li>Post-Processing:</li></ul><p>In post-production processing, the editor takes the keyed-out color and replaces it with the new background of their choice. This step creates the illusion that the subject is in a different setting or environment. The transparent areas become filled with the chosen background which, if done right, results in a cohesive and visually appealing composition.</p><h2 id="Why-Green"><a href="#Why-Green" class="headerlink" title="Why Green?"></a>Why Green?</h2><p>Theoretically, the <strong>chroma key background</strong> can be any solid color. However, the most commonly used colors are studio blue and bright green, with the latter far more common.</p><p>The choice of background color depends on the specific requirements of the production and the colors present in the scenes being filmed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Contrast</p><p>The less similar your chosen background color is to natural skin tones, the easier to isolate and replace in your footage. Bright green provides a strong contrast to most human skin tones and is less likely to be present in costumes or natural surroundings, making it easier to isolate subjects during the color separation.</p><p>Luminance</p><p> The color green emits light with greater intensity than blue, allowing for far more effective isolation by cameras during filming. This also means that blue screens demand increased lighting for proper exposure compared to green. This situation may be less than ideal if you lack powerful lighting or you don’t have the big bucks for them.</p><p>Digital Sensors</p><p> Many digital cameras and sensors are more sensitive to green wavelengths, resulting in cleaner and more accurate color keying during post-processing.

However, if you know your scene will have lots of green, it is probably best to film with a blue screen, so there’s less risk of color spill and less post-production work.</p><h2 id="Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio"><a href="#Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio"></a>Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio</h2><p>Setting up your chroma key is convenient and straightforward, but there are some key factors to consider while setting up to ensure maximal performance.</p><p>Choosing the Right Background Color</p><p>The first step in the chroma key setup is selecting the right background color to be keyed out. This choice determines your effective color separation and ensures a smooth keying process during editing. Choosing a chroma-key background color that contrasts distinctly with the subject’s colors is essential for effective color separation. This prevents unintentional transparency, color spill, and ensures a polished final result.</p><p>Lighting Considerations</p><p>Lighting is an important part of the chroma-keying process. Bold, uniform, and consistent lighting on both the subject and the background makes it easy to delineate one from the other fully. This minimizes shadows and variations in color, creating a smooth and seamless keying process. Multiple diffuse lights from different angles are often used to illuminate the green screen evenly.</p><p>Positioning&#x2F;Camera</p><p>Proper subject and camera placement are necessary to ensure an even color-keying process during post-production. To prevent shadow interference, the green screen should be smooth, tense, and without wrinkles or shadows.</p><p>High-quality cameras are essential every time, especially for chroma keying. Images with better definition are easier to key, so camera quality significantly affects the outcome. Even if your camera isn’t the best, merely shooting well can ensure a clean color-keying process during editing, resulting in professional-looking visuals.</p><h2 id="Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key"><a href="#Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key" class="headerlink" title="Recording Tips for Chroma Key"></a>Recording Tips for Chroma Key</h2><ul><li>Proper Lighting</li></ul><p>Maintaining uniform and well-defined lighting during recording is essential for a successful chroma-keying process. This consistency ensures a seamless keying process during post-production.</p><ul><li>Keep Distance from the Green Screen</li></ul><p>The optimal distance between the subject and the green screen minimizes color spill and allows for natural movements. Proper distance between subject and background allows for easier isolation of the background and much smoother post-editing. A recommended starting point for the issue is around 6 to 10 feet from the background.</p><ul><li>Subjects and Clothing</li></ul><p>As mentioned before, the choice of costume for Selecting appropriate clothing that doesn’t match the chroma key color prevents transparency issues. Subjects also have to be positioned in such a way that there is minimal light interference and reflection. These contribute to a flawless chroma key outcome.</p><h2 id="3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies"><a href="#3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies"></a>3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies</h2><ul><li>Color Spill</li></ul><p>Sometimes, reflected light from your green background can be cast on your subject and may remain so when the background light is keyed out. This phenomenon is known as a color spill. It is usually because of uneven lighting or shooting around reflecting surfaces. Avoiding spill can differentiate between good and lousy chroma key aftereffects.</p><p>Human hair is one area where color spill can show up unsuspectingly. Due to the translucency of hair, it is common for some unintended light to seep through. This allows some background visibility, which you do not want with a chroma key. This is especially notable with lighter hair colors like blond hair.</p><p>There are ways to account for this. Many video-editing software have features such as spill suppression and screen matte adjustments that can enhance the final footage. Specialized plugins also go a long way in ensuring minimizing spill. Addressing spill correction tackles unwanted green artifacts and ensures a clean keying process.</p><ul><li>Poor Lighting</li></ul><p>Suboptimal green screen lighting can lead to inconsistencies in keying and editing, undermining your product. One way to avoid this is to light the screen and subject separately. Another tip, although expensive, is using multiple diffuse light sources and trying to maintain even lighting across every square foot of your scene. Super bright or dark spots can ruin your output, so it’s worth the extra effort if you don’t want to deal with problematic post-production.</p><ul><li>Poorly Refined Edges</li></ul><p>Chroma keying should leave your videos with crisp, defined, natural-looking edges. But post-production editing can make all the difference if it doesn’t come out to your taste. Softening and refining edges make a smoother transition between the foreground object and the new background. Light adjustments to edge thickness and screen matte settings can also help enhance overall visual quality and add finesse to your work.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Green screen photography produces excellent results, and its ease of use makes it indispensable for videographers of all levels.

He makes enough money to live off of YouTube alone. Here is a case study of how he made his first $10,000 on YouTube:</p><h2 id="Case-Study-of-McJuggerNuggets-3"><a href="#Case-Study-of-McJuggerNuggets-3" class="headerlink" title="Case Study of McJuggerNuggets"></a>Case Study of McJuggerNuggets</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/case-study-mcjugger-nuggets.jpg"                      alt="Case Study McJugger Nuggets"                ></p><p>Jesse was one of the earliest YouTubers. He started his channel on December 9, 2006. Jesse never guessed that he would make enough money to live off of the videos he was creating. Here are some of the ways that he monetized his channel:</p><h4 id="AdSense-3"><a href="#AdSense-3" class="headerlink" title="AdSense"></a>AdSense</h4><p>Monetization of videos through AdSense is one of the easiest ways that you can start to profit off your videos. Registering for a <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/#?modal%5Factive=none" >Google AdSense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can earn you between $0.30 and $2.00 per thousand ad impressions (an impression is a click, not a view). How much you make per ad impression depends on a lot of things, including the time of year. There are good months for advertising revenue and bad months. December is usually the hottest month for making money through AdSense because of the holiday shopping season. Some of the other months where you can see huge profits include September for back-to-school, June, and March.</p><p>More popular channels get higher paying ads, and it is harder to earn ad revenue in popular vlogging genres (i.e. gaming) than in more obscure niches.</p><h4 id="Target-the-Right-Demographic-3"><a href="#Target-the-Right-Demographic-3" class="headerlink" title="Target the Right Demographic"></a>Target the Right Demographic</h4><p>Some of the largest YouTuber success stories are creators who primarily target younger audiences. Others target men or women specifically. Think about who you want your audience to be and make videos that will appeal to them.</p><h4 id="Multichannel-Networks-3"><a href="#Multichannel-Networks-3" class="headerlink" title="Multichannel Networks"></a>Multichannel Networks</h4><p>Once you hit a certain level of subscribership and views you will start getting invited to MCMs. In some cases, multichannel network promotions could entitle you to discounts on merchandise and products. Be careful: a multichannel network will always want you to sign a contract, and they will take over your AdSense account.</p><h4 id="Social-Blade-3"><a href="#Social-Blade-3" class="headerlink" title="Social Blade"></a>Social Blade</h4><p>This site will provide details about your subscription count, which of your videos has the best watch time, and more.

Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic"></a>3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic</h2><p>Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail. To make your thumbnails look polished, consider using small images (like emojis or hearts) to stand out. This will add color and personality to your thumbnail.</p><p>Make sure the images you choose are relevant to the topic of your video.</p><h2 id="4-Make-Your-Text-Huge"><a href="#4-Make-Your-Text-Huge" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Your Text Huge"></a>4. Make Your Text Huge</h2><p>If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.</p><p>Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.</p><h2 id="5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free"><a href="#5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep it Clutter-Free"></a>5. Keep it Clutter-Free</h2><p>It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much. You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.</p><p>A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words. That way they won’t clutter your screen, and you can make them large enough to read on small-screened devices.</p><p> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >For even more tips on making great YouTube thumbnails, click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Use these tips to make video thumbnails for YouTube, and tell us what kind of results you get!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>The <strong>video thumbnails</strong> you use for YouTube are vital to getting views and subscribers.
