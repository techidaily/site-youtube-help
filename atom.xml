Without any further ado, let’s take a look.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP"><a href="#Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP"></a>Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP</h4><p>This is, of course, the first thing that you need to do. Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you’ve left it over from some past event that’s long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it’s a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it’s not highlighted or you aren’t able to select it, the software doesn’t support it, and it’s not compatible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Import YouTube videos in FCP "                ></p><p>Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files. If you want to store videos from different channels, you can use the Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate in order to get them converted and stored on your computer in a format that is supported by FCP.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro"></a>Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro</h4><p>That’s the fun part. There are a few things that you can do with Final Cut Pro, and they are all quite professional.</p><ul><li>First, you can sync an audio track with your video as the DSLR cameras usually have terrible quality of the sound. This is why you want to get the audio recorded separately. The only thing you need to do is select the audio clip and click on the Synchronize Clips, and you are good to go.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sychronize-audio-clips-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Synchronize clips in FCP "                ></p><ul><li>Furthermore, you can do proper color balancing with the program quickly and incredibly easy. Go on Modify and then click on <strong>Balance Color</strong> and the software is going to take care of the rest on its own.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flip-clips-in-fcp-2.png"                      alt="adjust youtube video scale and position"                ></p><ul><li>You can also create previews when the video ends. In order to do so, you need to import your main clip, select a solid background color and place the preview video above it. You will then be able to trim and edit it conveniently. Adjust the scale and the position and you are good to go. Afterwards, you can also apply annotation on top of the preview.</li></ul><h4 id="Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly"><a href="#Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly"></a>Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-to-youtube-from-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Upload video to YouTube from FCP"                ></p><p>This one is rather easy. Here is the sequence that you need to do. Go to File -&gt; Share -&gt; Master File -&gt; Setting -&gt; File -&gt; Share -&gt; YouTube. That’s basically it. Then you need to sign in to your YouTube account and simply click on Next -&gt; Publish and the entire thing is done. That’s all you need to do in order to quickly and conveniently upload your video to YouTube directly from the FCP.</p><p>Check this video tutorial to see how YouTube creators edit their YouTubes videos with Final Cut Pro</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-precision-problem-solving-for-youtube-short-success/"><u>In 2024, Precision Problem-Solving for YouTube Short Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-selecting-the-perfect-online-source-15-best-royalty-free-music-urls/"><u>In 2024, Selecting the Perfect Online Source  15 Best Royalty-Free Music URLs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-sharing-lifes-moments-with-your-online-audience/"><u>[New] Sharing Life's Moments with Your Online Audience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-paving-the-way-for-individuality-in-the-digital-age-your-youtube-journey/"><u>[New] Paving the Way for Individuality in the Digital Age  Your YouTube Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/live-streaming-made-simple-google-meet-to-youtube-guide-for-2024/"><u>Live Streaming Made Simple  Google Meet to YouTube Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-graphic-portrayal-of-future-social-momentum/"><u>In 2024, Graphic Portrayal of Future Social Momentum</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-understanding-youtubers-income-average-ad-revenues-per-play/"><u>2024 Approved  Understanding Youtuber's Income  Average Ad Revenues per Play?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unseen-audiences-transform-your-zero-view-videos-with-these-tips/"><u>2024 Approved  Unseen Audiences  Transform Your Zero-View Videos with These Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-nextgen-youtuber-tools-studio-vs-beta-version/"><u>In 2024, NextGen YouTuber Tools  Studio Vs.

Smartphones have really great cameras, and you probably always have your phone with you. You can even post directly from your phone to YouTube!</p><h2 id="How-To-Make-YouTube-Videos-on-Your-Smartphone-1"><a href="#How-To-Make-YouTube-Videos-on-Your-Smartphone-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Make YouTube Videos on Your Smartphone"></a>How To Make YouTube Videos on Your Smartphone</h2><p> Making a video on your smartphone is similar to making a video with any other camera in a lot of ways. There are also a lot of ways in which it is different. You always have to watch out for camera shake, for example, but it can be even harder to control when you’re walking around shooting on your mobile device. Here are three things to keep in mind when vlogging with your smartphone.</p><h4 id="Part-1-Keep-It-Steady"><a href="#Part-1-Keep-It-Steady" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Keep It Steady"></a>Part 1. Keep It Steady</h4><p> For a nice, smooth, shot consider resting your hand up on a railing, table, or anything else that will keep it steady while you film. Camera shake is always distracting to viewers, and smartphone videos are notoriously unstable because you are almost always holding your phone in your hand.</p><p> There is equipment you can use to cut out camera shake. You can get a smartphone mount for your tripod, or you can even stabilize your phone using a selfie stick. Many of the very newest smartphones have built in hardware called ‘OIS’ – optical image stabilization – that helps reduce shakiness.</p><h4 id="Part-2-Be-Heard"><a href="#Part-2-Be-Heard" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Be Heard"></a>Part 2. Be Heard</h4><p> You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you say it! Smartphones do not tend to have very good microphones built in (neither do most cameras), so try to vlog from somewhere without a lot of background noise. It will help a lot if your voice has nothing to compete with.</p><p> Ideally, you should get an external mic to record your voice while you vlog on your phone. There are shotgun mics you can plug directly into the audio jack on your phone which will record great audio, or you can get a high quality MP3 recorder and carry it around in your pocket.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone"><a href="#Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Tilt Your Phone"></a>Part 3. Tilt Your Phone</h4><p> When recording on the spur of the moment with your smartphone it is easy to automatically hold it the same way you would while texting or taking a selfie. If you record a video with your phone held so that it is tall – a ‘portrait’ shot – then your video will have thick black bars on either side when you post it to YouTube. If you tilt your phone so that it is wide you will record a ‘landscape’ shot, which will match the dimensions YouTube plays videos in.</p><p> The exception to this is videos you plan to post on Instagram. On Instagram everything is cropped into a square, and it is easier to imagine what your footage will look like as a square when you hold your phone strait up. Simply focus on the top of your screen and treat a portion of the bottom of your screen as if it is not there. When you hold your phone horizontally you need to try and estimate how much of the middle of your screen will make it in to your Instagram video, which can be awkward.</p><p> Those are the three main things to keep in mind, but if you are planning on posting directly to YouTube from your phone then you should also make sure you have a mobile app you can use to edit it first.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a full-feature video editing app available for both Android and iPhone operating systems. With Filmora you can make awesome YouTube videos quickly using Filmora’s one-touch themes, or take a little bit more time personalizing your creation. One-touch themes are sets of related features, like filters and animated titles, which you can apply to your videos all at once. Filmora’s simple interface also makes it easy to apply filters, titles, overlays, transitions, and even royalty free music to your project one at a time.</p><p> After you’ve edited your video in Filmora you can post it directly to YouTube or other social media sites right from the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/mp3ify-your-favorite-videos-top-free-converters-online-for-2024/"><u>MP3ify Your Favorite Videos  Top Free Converters Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-your-content-leading-android-video-editors/"><u>2024 Approved  Streamline Your Content  Leading Android Video Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-yt-creator-hub-the-ultimate-playbook/"><u>In 2024, Mastering YT Creator Hub  The Ultimate Playbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-transforming-trips-into-tales-the-roadmap-to-becoming-a-travel-blogger/"><u>In 2024, Transforming Trips Into Tales  The Roadmap to Becoming a Travel Blogger</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-navigating-the-world-of-youtubers-and-gaming-sessions/"><u>[New] Navigating the World of YouTubers and Gaming Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-snicker-sonatas-top-10-humorous-hits/"><u>[New] Snicker Sonatas  Top 10 Humorous Hits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-revenue-sharing-explained-maximizing-profits-with-snippet-videos/"><u>[New] Revenue Sharing Explained  Maximizing Profits with Snippet Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/expert-tips-on-choosing-the-best-youtube-to-avi-software-for-2024/"><u>Expert Tips on Choosing the Best YouTube-to-AVI Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-learn-youtube-live-streaming-with-easy-obs-guide/"><u>In 2024, Learn YouTube Live Streaming with Easy OBS Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/maximizing-engagement-with-youtube-shorts-content-for-2024/"><u>Maximizing Engagement with YouTube Shorts Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-trustful-growth-how-to-properly-buy-tiktok-followers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Trustful Growth  How to Properly Buy TikTok Followers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/top-7-skype-hacker-to-hack-any-skype-account-on-your-samsung-galaxy-a34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Top 7 Skype Hacker to Hack Any Skype Account On your Samsung Galaxy A34 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-cheatsheet-for-stunning-collage-art/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step Cheatsheet for Stunning Collage Art</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-video-guide-to-hairstyles/"><u>[New] Ultimate Video Guide to Hairstyles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-explore-these-10-unique-tiktok-video-effects-for-2024/"><u>[New] Explore These 10 Unique TikTok Video Effects for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-review-elevating-your-recording-game-with-showmore/"><u>[Updated] In-Depth Review  Elevating Your Recording Game with ShowMore</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-becoming-the-next-star-how-to-utilize-voice-changer-plus-app-for-iphones-effectively/"><u>New In 2024, Becoming the Next Star How to Utilize Voice Changer Plus App for iPhones Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/tough-titans-tangle-choosing-between-t5-and-sjcam-s6/"><u>Tough Titans Tangle  Choosing Between T5 and SJCAM S6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-megadatasky-affordable-space-for-big-files/"><u>In 2024, MegaDataSky - Affordable Space for Big Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-free-dvd-player-roundup-top-picks-for-windows-10/"><u>Updated In 2024, Free DVD Player Roundup Top Picks for Windows 10</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

It provides statistics on our subscribers, views, and estimated revenue.</p><p>To start using Social Blade, type your channel name into the search bar.</p><p>On the top section of the page, several stats will be clearly displayed.</p><p>First, you will see the letter grade assigned to your channel by Social Blade. If it is not a very good one, keep in mind that channels with over 10, 000 might still only receive Cs. Only YouTube megastars are getting As and Bs.</p><p>Next to your grade are your subscriber and video view ranks, as well as a rank assigned to you by Social Blade.</p><p>On the second line, you will see the views and subscribers you got in the last 30 days and the percentage by which you are up or down. Simply searching for yourself and glancing at this line is the easiest way to see whether your channel is growing, even easier than in your YouTube Creator Studio.</p><p>The final line of the first section will show you an estimate of your monthly revenue.</p><p>If you scroll down to the second section you will be able to see your views, subscribers, and estimated earnings per day rather than per month. Growth is in green and loss is in red.</p><p>By looking at this chart you can see which videos benefited your channel most after they were posted (your videos are not listed, but you can see based on the day you posted them). This will give you a good idea of what your audience wants to see.</p><h2 id="Spying-on-Other-Channels"><a href="#Spying-on-Other-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Spying on Other Channels"></a>Spying on Other Channels</h2><p>When you check your stats, you type your channel name into the search bar. If you want to use Social Blade to monitor somebody else’s stats, type their channel name instead.</p><p>By looking up your direct competitors (channels about the same size as yours within your same genre) you will be able to see which of their videos are performing best for them when you combine the daily information Social Blade provides with your knowledge of what videos they posted when.</p><p>Knowing what is working for your rivals will help you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >design your content strategy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>You can also use Social Blade to look up huge YouTube stars who you admire, just to see how well they are doing.

Some features make it the most reliable tool of all times. The split screen presets, royalty-free music, video transitions, filters, text templates, and advanced color tuning, etc are the first and foremost requirement of an editor who is looking ahead to build a personal brand on YouTube channel and earn some money from it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="Your-Brand-is-Your-Unique-Message"><a href="#Your-Brand-is-Your-Unique-Message" class="headerlink" title="Your Brand is Your Unique Message"></a>Your Brand is Your Unique Message</h2><p>Competing on YouTube is all about offering value. Viewers should be able to find something on your channel that they can’t find anywhere else. This doesn’t mean you need to bend over backwards trying to<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-be-original-on-youtube-289.html" >invent brand new video ideas that nobody has ever tried before <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – it just means you need to focus on building your unique brand. That is what will make viewers subscribe to you instead of just watching one of your videos and then clicking away.</p><h2 id="The-Elevator-Pitch"><a href="#The-Elevator-Pitch" class="headerlink" title="The Elevator Pitch"></a>The Elevator Pitch</h2><p>If you had 20 seconds – a short elevator ride – to describe your channel in a way that would make someone want to subscribe, what would you say?</p><p>Think about if you were trying to describe your new favorite show to a friend. You wouldn’t stop at saying ‘it’s a comedy’ or ‘it’s about lawyers’ – that doesn’t really tell them anything. You would describe the style of comedy, the personalities of characters you love, and the kinds of plots the show offers.</p><p>You need to be able to do that when you talk about your channel.</p><blockquote><p>What is your style of comedy?</p><p>What is your attitude towards fashion?</p><p>What will a viewer get out of watching you make pasta that they won’t get from watching someone else make pasta?</p></blockquote><p>Work on developing an elevator pitch for your channel. It will help you define your brand for yourself, and it’ll be useful if you make a channel trailer.</p><h2 id="How-to-Start-Building-Your-Brand"><a href="#How-to-Start-Building-Your-Brand" class="headerlink" title="How to Start Building Your Brand"></a>How to Start Building Your Brand</h2><p>Building a brand should be intentional. You need to be yourself, but it’s not enough to just ‘be’. You need to create yourself.</p><p>  In order to figure out what unique value you’re bringing to YouTube you’ll need to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/understanding-youtube-analytics-%E2%80%93-take-charge-of-your-channel%21-286.html" >pay attention to your channel stats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and comments your viewers make. It can also be a good idea to ask for feedback from friends who you know will be honest with you.</p><p>You will notice patterns. There will be things you do in your video that people consistently like more and less. The way you build your brand is by cutting out the stuff that isn’t working and focusing more intentionally on the stuff that is. If people like it when you do meme humor, for example, do more meme humor and make incorporating that in your videos part of your brand.</p><p>Banners and thumbnails are also a part of your brand. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-youtube-banners-and-thumbnails-316.html" >More on that here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Being-Consistent"><a href="#Being-Consistent" class="headerlink" title="Being Consistent"></a>Being Consistent</h2><p>The key to branding is consistency. People need to be able to set expectations.</p><p>For every video you do, ask yourself these questions:</p><blockquote><p><em>Who are you?</em></p><p><em>What is your message?</em></p><p><em>What value are you providing?</em></p><p><em>Who is it for?</em></p></blockquote><p>The answers to these questions make up your brand. They may change gradually over time – i.e. if you start making videos as a 16 year old, for other 16 year olds, then the ‘Who is it for?’ will change as you and your subscriber base get older – but in general the answers should always be the same. If your ‘message’ is positive and empowering, then it should always be positive and empowering.</p><p>When you intentionally create your personal brand on YouTube, you take charge of the message you’re sending.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-navigating-authentic-growth-proven-youtube-view-strategies/"><u>[New] Navigating Authentic Growth  Proven YouTube View Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-stand-out-on-youtube-logo-tips-for-visibility/"><u>[New] Stand Out on YouTube  Logo Tips for Visibility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-video-content-free-downloader-apps-guide/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Video Content  Free Downloader Apps Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-streamers-to-millionaires-the-monetization-blueprint/"><u>In 2024, From Streamers to Millionaires  The Monetization Blueprint</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-streamline-content-discovery-leveraging-youtubes-featured-channel-guide/"><u>In 2024, Streamline Content Discovery  Leveraging Youtube's Featured Channel Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-extract-and-save-video-previews-free-and-easy/"><u>[New] Extract and Save Video Previews, Free & Easy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/insightful-comparisons-top-android-applications-for-youtube-download-for-2024/"><u>Insightful Comparisons  Top Android Applications for YouTube Download for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-snippets-to-stars-the-essence-of-video-musical-success/"><u>In 2024, From Snippets to Stars  The Essence of Video Musical Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-optimizing-ad-revenue-on-youtube-with-new-strategies/"><u>In 2024, Optimizing Ad Revenue on YouTube with New Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-transform-subtitles-quickly-best-8-converters-from-sub-to-streamlined-srtr/"><u>In 2024, Transform Subtitles Quickly!

However, because AE is a complex application and has a steep learning curve, this section explains the two alternative ways to get the same effect on your existing video footage.</p><h2 id="Method-1-How-to-Create-Bouncing-Text-in-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Method-1-How-to-Create-Bouncing-Text-in-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: How to Create Bouncing Text in Filmora Video Editor?"></a>Method 1: How to Create Bouncing Text in Filmora Video Editor?</h2><p>When talking about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the application is populated with several presets for texts and titles, animations, effects, filters, and much more.</p><p>These pre-built templates not only make your task easier, they also save your decent amount of time that you would spend while working with After Effects or any other similar app that requires you to build things from scratch.</p><p>You can follow the instructions given below to <strong>add animated bounce text</strong> to any of your video footages with Filmora:</p><h4 id="Step-1-Add-a-Footage-to-Timeline"><a href="#Step-1-Add-a-Footage-to-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Add a Footage to Timeline"></a>Step 1: Add a Footage to Timeline</h4><p>Launch Wondershare Filmora on your Windows or Mac PC. By default, the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of the project is set to 16:9. Click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left section, and select and import footage you want to add bounce text to.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Insert-Text-and-Add-Bounce-Effect"><a href="#Step-2-Insert-Text-and-Add-Bounce-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Insert Text and Add Bounce Effect"></a>Step 2: Insert Text and Add Bounce Effect</h4><p>Click <strong>Titles</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, and click and drag your preferred title template from the Library to the timeline. In case you don’t want any specific animation or style on the title, you can use the default title.</p><p>In the timeline, double-click the title you just added, use the upper-left section to edit the text, go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab from the left pane, scroll down the list, and double-click the <strong>Up Down 1</strong> or <strong>Up Down 2</strong> preset to apply the bounce effect to the credits. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes and to get back to the main window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-up-down-animation-to-bounce.jpg"                      alt="Create Bouncing Text video Filmora9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Shake Filters</strong></p><p>Go to <strong>Effects</strong> from the standard toolbar, expand the <strong>Filters</strong> category from the left pane, and click <strong>Shake</strong>. From the Library window, click and drag your preferred shake filter to the timeline. Here, I will choose Mild.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shake-filter.jpg"                      alt="Shake filters in Filmora9"                ></p><p>You can customize the default effect by double-clicking the shake filter in the timeline, using the sliders in the upper-left area of the interface to make necessary adjustments, and then clicking <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes and to get back to the previous interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mild-shake-filter-adjust.jpg"                      alt="Mild Shake filters adjust"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Export the Final Output</strong></p><p>Click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top of the interface, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab in the <strong>Export</strong> box, choose your preferred output format from the list in the left, make required customizations from the right pane, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-filmora9-video.jpg"                      alt="Filmora9 Export Options"                ></p><p>Now, you can add the bouncing text video and the background video to the timeline, and then place the bouncing text video above the background video track.</p><p>Double click the text track, go to the <strong>Chroma Key</strong> effect, select the <strong>Color Picker</strong> tool, and click anywhere in the Preview window to get things right. Finally, export the entire project to your preferred output format as explained in <strong>Step 4</strong>.</p><p>As explained before, Wondeshare Filmora makes the entire process of creating and adding <strong>bounce text</strong> effect pretty simple. With all the pre-build templates, and the versatility of the options that can be used to customize those presets, you can come up with the effects that are usually obtained when you start generating them from the scratch.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="Method-2-Generate-Animated-Bouncing-Texts-Online"><a href="#Method-2-Generate-Animated-Bouncing-Texts-Online" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Generate Animated Bouncing Texts Online"></a>Method 2: Generate Animated Bouncing Texts Online</h2><p>If you don’t want any heavy and resource-intensive app on your PC merely for some special text effects, you can try any of the online solutions instead. The benefit of using any such web app is that all the processing is done on site’s server, and it is only a web browser and an Internet connection that you need to have at your side.</p><p>Some most trusted websites to generate <strong>bounce text</strong> are listed below:</p><h4 id="1-ENGFTO"><a href="#1-ENGFTO" class="headerlink" title="1. ENGFTO"></a>1. ENGFTO</h4><p>Website: <a class="link"   href="https://engfto.com/index/create%5Fanimated%5Fbouncing%5Ftext/0-26" >https://engfto.com/index/create%5Fanimated%5Fbouncing%5Ftext/0-26 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/engfto-create-animated-bouncing-text.jpg"                      alt="Create Animated Bouncing Text with ENGFTO"                ></p><p>You can follow the instructions given below to use Engfto to generate bouncing text for your footages:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Animated Bouncing Text Page</strong></p><p>Launch your favorite web browser, and go to the link given above to get to the Engfto’s animated bouncing text page.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Customize Text and Preferences</strong></p><p>Modify the values in the fields under the <strong>SIZE AREA</strong> and <strong>TEXT</strong> sections to customize the text area, the text itself, its size, and font. Next, adjust the values in the fields under the <strong>EFFECT PARAMETERS</strong> section to get the required bounce effect. Also, use the fields under the <strong>BACKGROUND</strong> section to either change the background color, or pick a background image from your PC.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Obtain the Animated Text</strong></p><p>Click the <strong>SAVE GIF ANIMATION</strong> button from the lower section of the page to download the animated text to your PC.</p><h4 id="2-Loading-io"><a href="#2-Loading-io" class="headerlink" title="2. Loading.io"></a>2. Loading.io</h4><p>The instructions given below explain how to use Loading.io to get animated <strong>bounce text</strong> effect for your footages:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Loading.io Webpage</strong></p><p>Launch your favorite web browser and go to <a class="link"   href="https://loading.io/animation/text/" >https://loading.io/animation/text/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Customize the Text and Choose Animation Effect</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-bouncing-text-with-loadingio.jpg"                      alt="Create Animated Bouncing Text with Loading.io"                ></p><p>Use the options available on the webpage to type your text, and change its font, color, background, transparency level etc. Select <strong>Bounce</strong> (or any of its variants) from the <strong>Animation</strong> drop-down list, and adjust the speed using the <strong>Speed</strong> slider.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Obtain the Text</strong></p><p>Click your preferred option from next to the <strong>Download As</strong> section to download the animated text to your PC.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Regardless of the web solution you choose to generate and obtain animated <strong>bounce text</strong>, you will still need a post-production tool to add the downloaded text to your footage.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Generating <strong>bounce text</strong> effect is much simpler when you use Wondershare Filmora or any of the online solutions as explained in Method 2. While the former gives you more flexibility when it comes to customizations, the latter doesn’t require any app to be installed on your PC. In addition, many times the web apps offer their services for free, and therefore they are preferred by the novice users who are not much into post-production processes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-science-of-captivating-youtube-thumbnails/"><u>In 2024, The Science of Captivating YouTube Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-streamline-your-videos-10-best-flv-to-youtube-convertors/"><u>[New] Streamline Your Videos  10 Best FLV to YouTube Convertors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-pro-gamers-top-5-soundtrack-devices/"><u>In 2024, Pro Gamers' Top 5 Soundtrack Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-novel-talk-points-for-daily-videos/"><u>In 2024, Novel Talk Points for Daily Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-synchronized-screen-serenity-youtube-loops-on-television/"><u>In 2024, Synchronized Screen Serenity  YouTube Loops on Television</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/expertly-edited-content-choosing-the-best-editor-for-2024/"><u>Expertly Edited Content  Choosing The Best Editor for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/harness-the-power-of-imagery-top-7-free-thumbnail-makers-for-2024/"><u>Harness the Power of Imagery  Top 7 Free Thumbnail Makers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-rhythm-wizards-choice-online-tempo-tester-apps/"><u>[New] Rhythm Wizards' Choice  Online Tempo Tester Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-make-your-videos-epic-add-slow-motion-effects-for-free-with-filmora/"><u>New In 2024, Make Your Videos Epic Add Slow Motion Effects for Free with Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-nostalgic-narratives-capturing-moments-with-xiphone/"><u>[Updated] Nostalgic Narratives  Capturing Moments with XiPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-a-complete-blueprint-for-effortless-recording-of-live-hulu-on-various-systems/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  A Complete Blueprint for Effortless Recording of Live Hulu on Various Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-old-messages-from-your-vivo-v29-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>How to recover old messages from your Vivo V29 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-deal-with-the-oppo-a78-5g-screen-black-but-still-works-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Deal With the Oppo A78 5G Screen Black But Still Works? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-staying-above-copyright-infringement-insta-watermarks-explained/"><u>[Updated] Staying Above Copyright Infringement  Insta Watermarks Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-motorola-edge-40-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Monitor Motorola Edge 40 Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Here we recommend using Filmora to easily edit YouTube videos.</p><p>You can use Filmora to make YouTube videos with built-in royalty-free audio. Filmora also can help you make YouTube intros. It includes more than 500 templates, transitions, effects, and text resources.</p><h2 id="1-Not-Everyone-Who-Clicks-Adds-to-Your-View-Count"><a href="#1-Not-Everyone-Who-Clicks-Adds-to-Your-View-Count" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Everyone Who Clicks Adds to Your View Count"></a>1. Not Everyone Who Clicks Adds to Your View Count</h2><p>YouTube doesn’t provide a clear definition of what counts as a view, but we know that someone clicks on your video, and clicking right away doesn’t count. That’s how we know that watch time is a factor. Some studies conclude that a <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/library/social-video-metrics/#9" >full 30 seconds need to be viewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to register as one view, but there is no way to know for sure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-youtube-count-view.JPG"                      alt="how YouTube counts view"                ></p><h2 id="2-How-Does-YouTube-Count-Views"><a href="#2-How-Does-YouTube-Count-Views" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does YouTube Count Views?"></a>2. How Does YouTube Count Views?</h2><p>YouTube wants to be sure that views are coming from humans and not bots. So, during the first couple of hours after you publish a video, YouTube seems to be stricter about what they count. The views which are counted are the ones that YouTube believes to be legitimate. Sometimes, it ends up skipping legitimate views for the sake of discretion.</p><p>Once this window of time passes, it is likely that you will see the view counter start to update a lot more frequently. The counter could still revert to updating slower and more hesitantly, though, if YouTube’s algorithm thinks it’s detecting something fishy.</p><p>At times, your view count can even be frozen temporarily until the algorithm can validate the views you are receiving. This is done to ensure a fair and positive experience for everyone who creates content. View counts can be adjusted by the algorithm in either direction.</p><p>You May Also Like:<br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > 5 Tips To Get More Views With YouTube Optimization [Free Checklist] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="3-How-Does-YouTube’s-View-Count-Algorithm-Work"><a href="#3-How-Does-YouTube’s-View-Count-Algorithm-Work" class="headerlink" title="3. How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?"></a>3. How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?</h2><p>Termed by many as one of the most boggling algorithms of all time, it is really hard to decode the complete dynamics of the YouTube view count algorithm.</p><p>There are some tests you can run yourself to try to unpack it.</p><p>If you upload a video and then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >set it as unlisted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it won’t get any public views so you can experiment by doing things like watching for different lengths of time and seeing what gets counted.</p><p>You’ll have to use a computer in a different location and make sure the account is not the same as the one you used to upload the video. Now, you need to watch the video for roughly 15 seconds. The key here is to keep it less than 30 seconds. You will see that the view did not add to the count. If you repeat this process on multiple computers at varying locations and with different accounts and you are likely to find the same result.</p><p>However, if you watch it for 30 seconds or longer it is likely that the count will go up.</p><p>We are adding ‘likely’ here because, despite this 30-second rule which has been decoded, there are other factors that might contribute to whether a view is counted as well as other automated scanning techniques at play.</p><p>Try to watch the same video numerous times in a single day. You will find that the count will add up at first, but after some time it will stop. YouTube knows that a lot of times people replay some videos over and over when they really enjoy them, and so they want to factor replays into their algorithm because they suggest quality. However, to avoid spam views, the counter will stop after a certain point.</p><h2 id="4-Account-Tracking-Factors-Some-Viewers-Don’t-Count"><a href="#4-Account-Tracking-Factors-Some-Viewers-Don’t-Count" class="headerlink" title="4. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count"></a>4. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count</h2><p>Something else that can affect whether a view is counted is the behavior of the account which watches it prior to landing on your video’s watch page. Sometimes, YouTube might feel that there is an increased chance a particular account is actually a bot, and then views from that account might not be added.</p><p>One way that <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/27792330?hl=en" >YouTube might flag an account as a potential bot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is if it is jumping between videos directly without navigating through recommendations, the search engine, or the account’s subscriber feed (how are they getting between these watch page URLs if they aren’t clicking on anything YouTube can record?). To add to it, if the viewer is watching each of the videos for almost 30 seconds exactly (or less) there is an increased probability that it is not a human but a bot (or a human watching the bare minimum as part of a view exchange program).</p><p>Any bot-like action will result in an account’s views do not be added to your view count.</p><h2 id="5-The-Skip-Skim"><a href="#5-The-Skip-Skim" class="headerlink" title="5. The Skip &amp; Skim"></a>5. The Skip &amp; Skim</h2><p>It’s not uncommon for viewers to watch a video for say five seconds, skip forwards a bit and watch for another ten seconds as they look for a specific part. It is hard to say whether skipping through a video, but watching a scattered 30 seconds, would count as a view or not.</p><h2 id="6-Frozen-YouTube-View-Counts"><a href="#6-Frozen-YouTube-View-Counts" class="headerlink" title="6. Frozen YouTube View Counts"></a>6. Frozen YouTube View Counts</h2><p>Sometimes YouTube will freeze a view count in order to check that it is accurate. When the count is unfrozen, the count may jump up as views are validated or it can go down if YouTube detects a problem.</p><p>You can use <a class="link"   href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-analytics/" >YouTube’s analytics reports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to monitor an estimate of your potential views, but there is no assurance that this data will completely match your official view count.</p><h2 id="7-The-301-Mark"><a href="#7-The-301-Mark" class="headerlink" title="7. The 301 Mark"></a>7. The 301 Mark</h2><p>You may have seen a lot of videos that have a stagnant count of 301 views. The algorithm behind YouTube’s view counting system believes that any video which has fetched higher than 300 views has the ability to impact people’s perception of quality on YouTube. They do not want the homepage to be crowded with artificially popular videos.</p><p>This is why view counts are often frozen at 301. The employees at YouTube then manually verify whether the views obtained so far are legitimate or fake. Once the employees are sure that the views are legit, the counter is unfrozen and you will see an upward swing.</p><p>During the period when the view count is frozen every legitimate view is still counted, just not added immediately. Once the YouTube team is sure that your videos are not getting fake traffic, your view count will be updated to include views that were registered during the frozen phase. However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9100759/youtube-301-view-count-freeze-going-away" >YouTube says <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it won’t flag videos at 301 views anymore.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In short, we know YouTube expects a viewer to watch a video for around 30 seconds before it counts a view, that views from suspicious accounts are not counted, and that YouTube can decide to freeze your view count while they review your views. They are protecting the site from becoming saturated with videos that only look popular because of bots.

Since YouTube is a visual media platform, viewers set their eyes on the thumbnails first before they read the title of the video. If you’ve made a collage of YouTube thumbnails or designed YouTube channel art containing various freeze-frame images from different YouTube videos, you are no stranger to needing a fast way to collect YouTube thumbnail images. Online, there are several tools dedicated to solving this exact problem. These are the top five YouTube Thumbnail grabbers:</p><p>These thumbnails can be then be used in videos, blogs, articles, web pages, etc. Let’s have a look at 8 best thumbnail grabbers in the market:</p><ol><li><a href="#youtubegrabber1">YouTube Thumbnail Grabber</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber2">BoingBoing</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber3">Thumbnailsave.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber4">Get YouTube Thumbnail</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber5">Fbutube.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber6">YT Thumbnail Downloader</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber7">Youtubethumbnailimage.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber8">Youthumbnail.com</a></li></ol><h2 id="1-YouTube-Thumbnail-Grabber"><a href="#1-YouTube-Thumbnail-Grabber" class="headerlink" title="#1: YouTube Thumbnail Grabber"></a>#1: YouTube Thumbnail Grabber</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-grabber.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail Grabber"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com/" >https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>YouTube Thumbnail Grabber is at the top of our list. The website is very simple and clean with no ads. All you need to do is enter the YouTube video URL and click on the “Download Images” button. The site will then present you with your downloadable images in different sizes. It’s free and fast!</p><h2 id="2-BoingBoing"><a href="#2-BoingBoing" class="headerlink" title="#2: BoingBoing"></a>#2: BoingBoing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boing-boing.jpg"                      alt="Boing Boing"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://boingboing.net/features/getthumbs.html" >https://boingboing.net/features/getthumbs.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>BoingBoing is faster than YouTube Thumbnail grabber because it skips the “Download Images” step. As soon as you enter in your YouTube video URL, BoingBoing will automatically present you with your downloadable images. Although it is one step faster than YouTube Thumbnail Grabber, you will have to deal with having to view one small ad at the bottom of the page. In case you also want to download freeze frames that occur midway through the video, BoingBoing also gives you the option to download those images as well.</p><h2 id="3-Thumbnailsave-com"><a href="#3-Thumbnailsave-com" class="headerlink" title="#3: Thumbnailsave.com"></a>#3: Thumbnailsave.com</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/thumbnail-save.jpg"                      alt="Thumbnail Save"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://thumbnailsave.com/" >http://thumbnailsave.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Another free, straightforward website for grabbing your YouTube thumbnails is Thumbnailsave.com. Again, all you need to do is enter the YouTube video URL and click the “Submit” button. Unlike our first two options, this site has a lot more ads. You’ll see a banner ad at the top as well as an ad to the side of the page. One interesting thing about this website is that it displays a column of thumbnails recently grabbed by users all over the world (displayed on the right side of the page). You might find this entertaining. If you are captivated by one of the thumbnail images, you can download it onto your computer and then do a reverse image search on Google to find the video.</p><h2 id="4-Get-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#4-Get-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="#4: Get YouTube Thumbnail"></a>#4: Get YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-youtube-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Get YouTube Thumbnail"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.get-youtube-thumbnail.com/" >http://www.get-youtube-thumbnail.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Get YouTube Thumbnail is another free, straightforward tool for grabbing YouTube thumbnail images. All you need to do is paste the URL of the YouTube video and click on the “Get YouTube Thumbnail” button to retrieve your thumbnail. Yes, that’s right. One thumbnail image. What’s different about this website is that it provides you with a unique image URL. This might be useful for anyone not wanting to deal with files. While this website is free to use, it does have ads.</p><h2 id="5-Fbutube-com"><a href="#5-Fbutube-com" class="headerlink" title="#5: Fbutube.com"></a>#5: Fbutube.com</h2><p>Fbtube.com is a tool that is used to download YouTube thumbnails by bloggers, YouTubers, graphic designers, etc. This tool helps to grab all the thumbnails available for a YouTube video.

Some YouTubers just love making videos and created their channels so they would have somewhere to post their work. Others have strong opinions they need a platform to share. There are a lot of people on YouTube whose main interest is in a separate website or other social media page, but they use their YouTube channels to help generate traffic. If you are considering starting your own YouTube channel then you should take a second to consider why you want to, since this will have an impact on what kind of videos you make. Your reasons for wanting to make a YouTube account do not have to be very elaborate. Maybe you just think it will be fun. Good news; it will be!</p><p>Once you know for sure that you want to create a YouTube account, and also know why you want to do it, you have already started building your channel. There are still a few important things to consider, though. This article will walk you through signing up for a YouTube account, and give you some tips about starting your channel.</p><h2 id="Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps"><a href="#Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps"></a>Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to YouTube.com and look at the top right corner of your screen. There will either be a blue Sign In button, or an icon representing you. YouTube accounts and Google accounts are the same, so if you are signed into your Gmail account you are already signed into YouTube as well.</p><p>2. If you see a Sign In button, click it. If you see your icon click on that, and in the window that pops up select Add Account. Either way, you will be taken into a sign in screen. Under where it asks for your email address it will say Create Account. Click on Create Account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-sign-in-screen.JPG"                      alt="account sign in screen"                ></p><p>3. In the sign up page you will need to put in your name, email address, and mobile phone number as well as some other personal information. Do not enter your current Gmail address. Enter an alternate email you have created for your vlog, or click on I would like a new Gmail address. This will change your page slightly so that the email field becomes Choose a Username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account new gmail"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-after-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account after new gmail"                ></p><p>You will probably need to try a few different usernames before you find one that is not taken.</p><p>4. You will have to put in both a first and last name when you create your account, but you can change it to one name later.</p><p>5. Your password will need to be at least 8 characters long. Try to use a combination of letters or numbers, and make sure it is not something easily guessable (i.e spouses name).</p><p>6. After you finish the form click Next Step and, in the next screen, Continue to YouTube.</p><h2 id="Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel"></a>Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel</h2><h4 id="1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love"><a href="#1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose a Topic you Love"></a>1. Choose a Topic you Love</h4><p>When choosing a topic for your YouTube channel make sure you pick something you are passionate about. If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p><p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular. Follow your passion.</p><h4 id="2-Check-out-the-Competition"><a href="#2-Check-out-the-Competition" class="headerlink" title="2. Check out the Competition"></a>2. Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-a-Great-Name"><a href="#3-Choose-a-Great-Name" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose a Great Name"></a>3. Choose a Great Name</h4><p>Picking a great name for your YouTube account can take a lot of effort. Chances are you will not want to use your own name, at least not in full. Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p><p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow. Brainstorm a long list of potential names that are actually good and keep on trying them out until you find one that’s available.</p><p>For more information on naming your YouTube channel read our post ‘How To Pick a Name for Your YouTube Channel’.</p><h4 id="4-Make-a-Schedule"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule"></a>4. Make a Schedule</h4><p>Maintaining a YouTube channel is a big time commitment. You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p><p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like. They are more likely to subscribe and tune in for every post if they are given a chance to anticipate when your new entry is coming.</p><h4 id="5-Take-Inventory"><a href="#5-Take-Inventory" class="headerlink" title="5. Take Inventory"></a>5. Take Inventory</h4><p>Think about what equipment you have that you can use for your YouTube channel. The only thing you absolutely cannot get by without is a decent camera, but there are other types of equipment that it is a good idea to have too. Lights, a tripod, an external microphone – these are all things that a lot of YouTubers find they need in order to produce great videos. If you do not have these things, or money you are prepared to invest in them, then you will need to find ways around them until your situation changes.

However, these videos are getting the highest traction, and more videos are getting onboard about various products.</p><p>And, if you haven’t already checked one, an unboxing video is what it sounds like. At its core, “unboxing” is the procedure of recording the moment when a particular product is removed and opened from the packaging sold in.</p><p>Again, you’re probably thinking:</p><p>‘Why would anybody gaze at other folks opening their product packaging?’</p><p>More than 90,000 people type ‘unboxing’ into YouTube each month, and that’s quite interesting as well as strange. Also, these are just a few of the insane statistics about the eCommerce trend of unboxing videos.</p><p>In this article, you’ll see the science behind such unboxing videos and learn how to create an attractive one by taking inspiration from others.</p><p>So whether you’re not sure why we admire unboxing videos or you wish to know how to use them to your benefit, you’re in the right place!</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is an Unboxing Video?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">FAQs about Unboxing Videos</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?</strong></h2><p>Within the unboxing videos, people open boxes and narrate their actions. Unboxing videos are incredibly famous with kids, grabbing up tons of millions of subscribers as well as millions of views. Such videos are also usually great for kids to watch (with a few caveats). But the matter of the subject of some unboxing videos is not age-appropriate. And, there are niche-specific videos as well on different channels.</p><p>Are unboxers paid by the companies whose services or products they consider opening on YouTube? Companies don’t generally pay the YouTuber directly for featuring their products in a video. When an unboxer becomes super popular (with subscribers and tens of millions of views), companies may send the products for free, but not always. Sometimes hosts disclose this, sometimes not. However, companies do sponsor highly famous and influential YouTubers in other areas. For instance, they may pay the YouTuber to make a personal appearance at a toy store or convention.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels"></a><strong>Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</strong></h2><p>There are considerable merits to offering your customers a branded and personalized unboxing experience.</p><p>Even if you decide to get your products featured in a YouTuber’s unboxing videos, you can help promote your brand and improve brand awareness. So which is the perfect or ideal YouTube channel for unboxing videos for you to try to get featured on? The answer is: “It depends!”</p><p>Not every YouTuber is the best for every eCommerce business—and a YouTube channel simply being huge and influential doesn’t make it relevant for your brand. So it’s essential to consider brand suitability while trying looking for a YouTuber to create unboxing videos.</p><p>This means considering whether they use harsh language or if their target audience has some overlap with your target audience.</p><p>Keeping it in mind, here are some of the top YouTube unboxing channels for inspiration:</p><h3 id="1-Unbox-Therapy"><a href="#1-Unbox-Therapy" class="headerlink" title="1.

Don’t Delay the Unboxing in Your Video</p><p>6. Show the Product in Use</p><p>One of the prominent factors about unboxing videos is that anyone can make them.

Do you like to introduce your customers to your products in your own YouTube Channel, so you have total control over the content and messaging of each video?</p><p>Here is a step by step guide to help you revamp the creation of your unboxing video:</p><h3 id="1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software"><a href="#1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software"></a>1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software</h3><p>While you probably don’t require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.</p><p>In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it. This way, you don’t have to hold onto your camera by yourself (or have an assistant hold it) while you’re filming. In addition, this minimizes camera shake, which assists in making easy-to-watch videos.</p><p>On the other hand, video editing software is a must for taking all of your video compiling and recording into a cohesive video that will be attractive for viewers to watch. There are tons of accessible video editing tools to choose from and some paid options that may have helpful features. However, our favorite pick is Wondershare Filmora due to its beginner-friendly yet professional editing elements. Let us know what you can’t do with this software! It’s a combination of professionalism and reliability you can consider for all your video editing needs.</p><p>The hottest feature of Wondershare Filmora for making attractive unboxing videos is audio ducking. With this feature, you can effectively lower the background vocals while adding your voiceovers.

Unboxing videos are incredibly famous with kids, grabbing up tons of millions of subscribers as well as millions of views. Such videos are also usually great for kids to watch (with a few caveats). But the matter of the subject of some unboxing videos is not age-appropriate. And, there are niche-specific videos as well on different channels.</p><p>Are unboxers paid by the companies whose services or products they consider opening on YouTube? Companies don’t generally pay the YouTuber directly for featuring their products in a video. When an unboxer becomes super popular (with subscribers and tens of millions of views), companies may send the products for free, but not always. Sometimes hosts disclose this, sometimes not. However, companies do sponsor highly famous and influential YouTubers in other areas. For instance, they may pay the YouTuber to make a personal appearance at a toy store or convention.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels-1"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels"></a><strong>Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</strong></h2><p>There are considerable merits to offering your customers a branded and personalized unboxing experience.</p><p>Even if you decide to get your products featured in a YouTuber’s unboxing videos, you can help promote your brand and improve brand awareness. So which is the perfect or ideal YouTube channel for unboxing videos for you to try to get featured on? The answer is: “It depends!”</p><p>Not every YouTuber is the best for every eCommerce business—and a YouTube channel simply being huge and influential doesn’t make it relevant for your brand.

Select an Unboxing Niche</p><p>2. Practice Speaking Clearly and Slowly</p><p>3. Use the Best Unboxing Set-Up</p><p>4. Make Sure to Timely Unbox the Products</p><p>5. Don’t Delay the Unboxing in Your Video</p><p>6. Show the Product in Use</p><p>One of the prominent factors about unboxing videos is that anyone can make them. You don’t need to be uniquely talented but go with the products that have broad appeal. Once you create such videos, you can share them on your social media networks or personal website.</p><p>Do you want to create your creative unboxing videos for others to find? Do you like to introduce your customers to your products in your own YouTube Channel, so you have total control over the content and messaging of each video?</p><p>Here is a step by step guide to help you revamp the creation of your unboxing video:</p><h3 id="1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software-2"><a href="#1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software"></a>1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software</h3><p>While you probably don’t require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.</p><p>In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it. This way, you don’t have to hold onto your camera by yourself (or have an assistant hold it) while you’re filming. In addition, this minimizes camera shake, which assists in making easy-to-watch videos.</p><p>On the other hand, video editing software is a must for taking all of your video compiling and recording into a cohesive video that will be attractive for viewers to watch. There are tons of accessible video editing tools to choose from and some paid options that may have helpful features. However, our favorite pick is Wondershare Filmora due to its beginner-friendly yet professional editing elements. Let us know what you can’t do with this software! It’s a combination of professionalism and reliability you can consider for all your video editing needs.</p><p>The hottest feature of Wondershare Filmora for making attractive unboxing videos is audio ducking. With this feature, you can effectively lower the background vocals while adding your voiceovers. And, that’s extremely valuable in making these kinds of videos.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmorax boxpng "                ></p><h3 id="2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox-2"><a href="#2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Prepare Your Stage&#x2F;Photo Lightbox"></a>2. Prepare Your Stage&#x2F;Photo Lightbox</h3><p>If you look at some famous unboxing channels listed above, you’ll notice that much of their content is shot in a well-framed space where there isn’t much in the background to disturb them from the product being viewed.</p><p>Often, this is a “photo lightbox” or an empty table (a small container with a smooth white backdrop that enhances lighting while reducing shadows for making photos look greater). Lightboxes can also be helpful when you’re taking snapshots of your products to put up on your eCommerce website, so it’s a great idea to make (or buy) one that can fit your products.</p><h3 id="3-Practice-Making-Videos-2"><a href="#3-Practice-Making-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Practice Making Videos"></a>3. Practice Making Videos</h3><p>Before uploading videos to YouTube, take some time to practice making your unboxing videos using random items or already-opened products. This way, you can work upon setting up your stage and camera, keeping the product within an aim, narrating your unboxing video, editing footage to reduce the “dead air” where nothing is being done or said, and more!</p><p>When you’re over making your first test video, play it back and look for issues like excessive “ums, ahs,” or things that are out of focus and other sentence fillers. Don’t worry if your first video isn’t that great—that’s what practice (and your video editing software) are for!</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-Waste-Your-Viewers’-Time-2"><a href="#4-Don’t-Waste-Your-Viewers’-Time-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Waste Your Viewers’ Time"></a>4. Don’t Waste Your Viewers’ Time</h3><p>If you want to make the best unboxing videos, ensure that you get to the “unboxing” section quite instantly! As indicated by the Expert Voice: “remember that you compete for viewers’ attention with lots of other video content. Keep your introductions brief and quickly get to the unboxing.” If you take too much time to get to the section of unboxing video, you risk losing your audience’s interest and them going away from your content before you can introduce your product.</p><h3 id="5-Compile-Things-Up-Once-in-a-While-2"><a href="#5-Compile-Things-Up-Once-in-a-While-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Compile Things Up Once in a While"></a>5. Compile Things Up Once in a While</h3><p>If you unbox your products, you might instantly run out of content ideas to make. You may look up your YouTube channel losing traction without the new content. So, try to compile things up once in a while—as the Ryan’s World channel discussed earlier.</p><p>Creating other kinds of content, such as how-to videos and advice videos for specific products, product updates, and simple news, or even short promotional bits, can help keep your publishing frequency top-notch.</p><p>Just remember: everything you publish or post should still be related to your brand and your channel’s core content!</p><h3 id="6-Promote-Your-YouTube-Video-or-Channel-on-Social-Media-2"><a href="#6-Promote-Your-YouTube-Video-or-Channel-on-Social-Media-2" class="headerlink" title="6.

It must be vocal, and for you to show your face as well would be even better.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Unboxing videos are a bang on that; hate them or love them, they are here to stay.

Select an Unboxing Niche</p><p>2. Practice Speaking Clearly and Slowly</p><p>3. Use the Best Unboxing Set-Up</p><p>4. Make Sure to Timely Unbox the Products</p><p>5. Don’t Delay the Unboxing in Your Video</p><p>6. Show the Product in Use</p><p>One of the prominent factors about unboxing videos is that anyone can make them. You don’t need to be uniquely talented but go with the products that have broad appeal. Once you create such videos, you can share them on your social media networks or personal website.</p><p>Do you want to create your creative unboxing videos for others to find? Do you like to introduce your customers to your products in your own YouTube Channel, so you have total control over the content and messaging of each video?</p><p>Here is a step by step guide to help you revamp the creation of your unboxing video:</p><h3 id="1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software-3"><a href="#1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software"></a>1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software</h3><p>While you probably don’t require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.</p><p>In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it. This way, you don’t have to hold onto your camera by yourself (or have an assistant hold it) while you’re filming. In addition, this minimizes camera shake, which assists in making easy-to-watch videos.</p><p>On the other hand, video editing software is a must for taking all of your video compiling and recording into a cohesive video that will be attractive for viewers to watch. There are tons of accessible video editing tools to choose from and some paid options that may have helpful features. However, our favorite pick is Wondershare Filmora due to its beginner-friendly yet professional editing elements. Let us know what you can’t do with this software! It’s a combination of professionalism and reliability you can consider for all your video editing needs.</p><p>The hottest feature of Wondershare Filmora for making attractive unboxing videos is audio ducking. With this feature, you can effectively lower the background vocals while adding your voiceovers. And, that’s extremely valuable in making these kinds of videos.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmorax boxpng "                ></p><h3 id="2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox-3"><a href="#2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Prepare Your Stage&#x2F;Photo Lightbox"></a>2. Prepare Your Stage&#x2F;Photo Lightbox</h3><p>If you look at some famous unboxing channels listed above, you’ll notice that much of their content is shot in a well-framed space where there isn’t much in the background to disturb them from the product being viewed.</p><p>Often, this is a “photo lightbox” or an empty table (a small container with a smooth white backdrop that enhances lighting while reducing shadows for making photos look greater). Lightboxes can also be helpful when you’re taking snapshots of your products to put up on your eCommerce website, so it’s a great idea to make (or buy) one that can fit your products.</p><h3 id="3-Practice-Making-Videos-3"><a href="#3-Practice-Making-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Practice Making Videos"></a>3. Practice Making Videos</h3><p>Before uploading videos to YouTube, take some time to practice making your unboxing videos using random items or already-opened products. This way, you can work upon setting up your stage and camera, keeping the product within an aim, narrating your unboxing video, editing footage to reduce the “dead air” where nothing is being done or said, and more!</p><p>When you’re over making your first test video, play it back and look for issues like excessive “ums, ahs,” or things that are out of focus and other sentence fillers. Don’t worry if your first video isn’t that great—that’s what practice (and your video editing software) are for!</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-Waste-Your-Viewers’-Time-3"><a href="#4-Don’t-Waste-Your-Viewers’-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Waste Your Viewers’ Time"></a>4. Don’t Waste Your Viewers’ Time</h3><p>If you want to make the best unboxing videos, ensure that you get to the “unboxing” section quite instantly! As indicated by the Expert Voice: “remember that you compete for viewers’ attention with lots of other video content. Keep your introductions brief and quickly get to the unboxing.” If you take too much time to get to the section of unboxing video, you risk losing your audience’s interest and them going away from your content before you can introduce your product.</p><h3 id="5-Compile-Things-Up-Once-in-a-While-3"><a href="#5-Compile-Things-Up-Once-in-a-While-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Compile Things Up Once in a While"></a>5. Compile Things Up Once in a While</h3><p>If you unbox your products, you might instantly run out of content ideas to make. You may look up your YouTube channel losing traction without the new content. So, try to compile things up once in a while—as the Ryan’s World channel discussed earlier.</p><p>Creating other kinds of content, such as how-to videos and advice videos for specific products, product updates, and simple news, or even short promotional bits, can help keep your publishing frequency top-notch.</p><p>Just remember: everything you publish or post should still be related to your brand and your channel’s core content!</p><h3 id="6-Promote-Your-YouTube-Video-or-Channel-on-Social-Media-3"><a href="#6-Promote-Your-YouTube-Video-or-Channel-on-Social-Media-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

It must be vocal, and for you to show your face as well would be even better.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Unboxing videos are a bang on that; hate them or love them, they are here to stay.

Previously known as the Google Hangouts on Air, the YouTube Live feature is fairly simple to set up, but before you start your first webinar you will need to choose a landing page and a chatbox.

In this article, we will teach you about some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video formats and settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>To upload a video to YouTube you have to make sure that you are using one of the video file formats that is supported by the platform itself. Here they are:</p><p>  - MP4</p><p> - MOV</p><p> - AVI</p><p> - FLV</p><p> - 3GPP</p><p> - WMV</p><p> - WebM</p><p> - MPEGS</p><p> <strong>YouTube recommends uploading your videos as MP4 files.</strong> Some benefits of MP4s are that the files are not as large as AVIs, they provide better quality than FLVs, and they often display with the same quality or better as you would get watching the video on a native video player. Other file formats like 3GPP and MPEG-PS generally have resolutions too small for high-resolution tablets or desktop devices.</p><p>If your phone or video editing software does not output MP4 videos, consider getting video editing software or a conversion program that can (like Filmora Video Editor).</p><p>Filmora is an easy-to-use video editing program that can export to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, F4V, MKV, TS, 3GP, MPEG-2, WEBM, GIF, and MP3. You can convert a video to an MP4 simply by importing it into Filmora, dragging it into the timeline, and exporting it in the MP4 format.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Upload-Settings-for-YouTube"><a href="#The-Best-Upload-Settings-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="The Best Upload Settings for YouTube"></a>The Best Upload Settings for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The best video code:</strong></p><p><strong>The best video format:</strong> MP4</p><p>Audio should be produced using the LC format and stereo 5.1 or standard stereo. You can upload separate MP3 audio format files for voiceovers if you need to.</p><p>The aspect ratio for a video should be 16:9 so that it won’t have black bars on the side when uploaded to YouTube. YouTube has also made it possible for 9:16 (portrait) style videos to be viewed without black bars, full screen, using their iOS app.</p><p>You should export in at least 30 frames per second. Many creators push that to 60 frames per second, which is better for most types of videos (although it may not make a noticeable difference for others).</p><p>The maximum size for quick upload and load time on YouTube is generally under 2gb. Luckily MP4 offers a great degree of compression without sacrificing too much image quality.</p><p>If you scale down the file size of the video by reducing the resolution or choosing a format with more compression, that can cause you to lose quality. If you need a smaller file, it’s always better to scale down the length of a video rather than continually compress the file or lose frames from the video.</p><p>Although a 2 GB file of a very long will easily upload to YouTube, it will probably be very low quality.</p><p> Do you agree that MP4 is the best video format for YouTube, or do you use something else?</p><h2

YouTube Live Vs. Periscope: What’s the Difference?"></a>Facebook Live Vs. YouTube Live Vs. Periscope: What’s the Difference?</h2><p><strong>1. Audience:</strong></p><p> We all know that Facebook is currently having highest user base so naturally Facebook Live is assumed to have more viewers and streamers. Google considers most of the YouTube content valuable but note that it is YouTube not the recently updated YouTube Live platform. On the other side, if we talk about Periscope then it can be best described as a standalone network. In case if it gets linked to main app YouTube then it may avail some popularity in the market, same as that of Facebook. If you are a beginner then probably, Facebook is the best choice for you as it can provide more audience over the nights. Periscope users can also enjoy healthy content over Mobile phones with great stream quality. One more interesting thing to know about Periscope is that it can be used to develop healthy relationships with so many viewers and followers.</p><p><strong>2. User Interface:</strong></p><p> Here is one more interesting factor to discuss about all these amazing Live streaming platforms. This feature makes a system or software standout among other competitors. If we compare user interface of Facebook Live, Periscope and YouTube Live then you will find them all almost similar. But most of the beginners rate Facebook as most simple and user friendly tool for live broadcasts. Second rating is received by Periscope whereas YouTube Live stands on third level. User interface of Periscope and Facebook live possesses so many similar features such as ability to subscribe, comment or updating likes etc.</p><p><strong>3. Saving Broadcasts and Embedding Replays:</strong></p><p> Let us discuss about saving broadcasts as well as get some idea about their ability to arrange embedding replays. The video archiving ability of YouTube and Facebook is having almost similar kind of features. Users are able to update their live streams and they can also be saved for longer run, even permanently as per need. If you want to delete them then simple controls allow easy removal of updated broadcasts from channel. On the other side, Periscope allows live streamers to stay on channel only for 24 hours. After that, all the updated videos get automatically deleted. On Facebook, users cannot come to know about who is watching their live streams until and unless they receive comments from viewers. Although, Facebook keep on updating notifications about all live streams but more often they create a bug. In case of Periscope, whenever a person starts viewing your uploaded content, his name will directly appear at your end. It can help you to know the real strength of your updates so that you can improve quality of content as per interest of viewers. It is also possible to make private or public settings for broadcasts on Periscope whereas Facebook is gaining more popularity for its Split Screen and 360 videos.</p><p><strong>4. Interaction:</strong></p><p><strong>Communicate with Broadcasters:</strong></p><p> If you want to interact with broadcaster on Facebook then you can simply update your comment or show them your reaction with emojies. They can be updated at the time of live broadcasts as well as at the time of replay. Most of the Facebook users are unhappy with its lag time as broadcasters comment gets published after a delay of 30 seconds. In case of Periscope, viewers are able to just comment on live broadcasts and they can also update a heart for their favourite content. If we compare the lag time of Facebook and Periscope then it is lower for Periscope and people often enjoy instantaneous conversations over this network. The best part is that Viewers can update numbers of hearts even for single broadcast and all of them will get recorded. This feature is not available with Facebook emojies. You will be glad to know that once you have prepared account over YouTube then same details can be used to access Periscope platform.</p><p><strong>Interaction with Viewers:</strong></p><p> Facebook allows broadcasters and viewers to enjoy healthy communication as here talks can be initiated by updating name of the person before writing comment. If you want to communicate with all viewers in more professional manner then Facebook’s name based comment updates are best choices. Note that, facebook allows users to enjoy communicate even when stream has already ended. In case of Periscope, again viewers and broadcasters can enjoy direct name to name comment based conversations.

Google considers most of the YouTube content valuable but note that it is YouTube not the recently updated YouTube Live platform. On the other side, if we talk about Periscope then it can be best described as a standalone network. In case if it gets linked to main app YouTube then it may avail some popularity in the market, same as that of Facebook. If you are a beginner then probably, Facebook is the best choice for you as it can provide more audience over the nights. Periscope users can also enjoy healthy content over Mobile phones with great stream quality.

If you want to delete them then simple controls allow easy removal of updated broadcasts from channel. On the other side, Periscope allows live streamers to stay on channel only for 24 hours. After that, all the updated videos get automatically deleted. On Facebook, users cannot come to know about who is watching their live streams until and unless they receive comments from viewers. Although, Facebook keep on updating notifications about all live streams but more often they create a bug. In case of Periscope, whenever a person starts viewing your uploaded content, his name will directly appear at your end. It can help you to know the real strength of your updates so that you can improve quality of content as per interest of viewers. It is also possible to make private or public settings for broadcasts on Periscope whereas Facebook is gaining more popularity for its Split Screen and 360 videos.</p><p><strong>4.

If we compare the lag time of Facebook and Periscope then it is lower for Periscope and people often enjoy instantaneous conversations over this network. The best part is that Viewers can update numbers of hearts even for single broadcast and all of them will get recorded. This feature is not available with Facebook emojies.

It can help you to know the real strength of your updates so that you can improve quality of content as per interest of viewers. It is also possible to make private or public settings for broadcasts on Periscope whereas Facebook is gaining more popularity for its Split Screen and 360 videos.</p><p><strong>4. Interaction:</strong></p><p><strong>Communicate with Broadcasters:</strong></p><p> If you want to interact with broadcaster on Facebook then you can simply update your comment or show them your reaction with emojies. They can be updated at the time of live broadcasts as well as at the time of replay. Most of the Facebook users are unhappy with its lag time as broadcasters comment gets published after a delay of 30 seconds. In case of Periscope, viewers are able to just comment on live broadcasts and they can also update a heart for their favourite content. If we compare the lag time of Facebook and Periscope then it is lower for Periscope and people often enjoy instantaneous conversations over this network. The best part is that Viewers can update numbers of hearts even for single broadcast and all of them will get recorded. This feature is not available with Facebook emojies. You will be glad to know that once you have prepared account over YouTube then same details can be used to access Periscope platform.</p><p><strong>Interaction with Viewers:</strong></p><p> Facebook allows broadcasters and viewers to enjoy healthy communication as here talks can be initiated by updating name of the person before writing comment. If you want to communicate with all viewers in more professional manner then Facebook’s name based comment updates are best choices. Note that, facebook allows users to enjoy communicate even when stream has already ended. In case of Periscope, again viewers and broadcasters can enjoy direct name to name comment based conversations. Periscope broadcasts can also be enjoyed on Twitter platform directly but here you cannot update hearts directly. Also, comments remains dedicated to Twitter and Periscope environment. YouTube Live allows users to share their viewing experiences with comments and it helps broadcasters to get feedbacks for improvement. Content from YouTube Live can also be shared on other platforms.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-editors-edge-advanced-tactics-for-youtube-video-spins-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  The Editor's Edge  Advanced Tactics for YouTube Video Spins (Guide)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transform-your-unboxing-videos-with-these-tips/"><u>2024 Approved  Transform Your Unboxing Videos with These Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-how-to-add-logo-or-watermark-to-youtube-video/"><u>[New] How to Add Logo or Watermark to YouTube Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-from-ingredients-to-inspiration-cooking-videos/"><u>[New] From Ingredients to Inspiration  Cooking Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-broadcast-your-online-meeting-via-youtube-google-meet-steps/"><u>2024 Approved  How To Broadcast Your Online Meeting via YouTube -
