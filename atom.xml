Therefore, YouTube merged the Shorts Fund with the YPP in February 2023.

Making Money with YouTube Shorts: Eligibility and Earnings</strong></h2><p>The new YouTube Shorts monetization policy means that content creators on YouTube with access to the YPP can also earn from Shorts.

It involves three different sources of light in the shot and is used by portrait photographers, which is also a great method for lighting your vlog.</p><p>The brightest source of light is also known as the <strong>key light</strong> which need to be high quality. A window will work, but if you do not have access to one where you are filming then consider an LED panel light or a softbox light like the ones used in portrait photography.</p><p>This first light will create a dramatic shadow across half of your face. You want to reduce this shadow, but not get rid of it completely.</p><p>Rather than setting up another light source on the opposite side of the camera, put up a reflector to bounce some light back onto your face. This reflector is called your <strong>‘Fill Light’</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>fill light</strong> is less bright than the primary source of light and it is placed on the side opposite to the key light. Its purpose is to reduce shadows produced by the key light and the reflector will need to be mounted on a stand.</p><p>The final step to creating three point lighting is to set up another light behind you. This is your ‘Backlight’, and it will help you stand out from your background. <strong>Backlight or Hair light</strong> is always placed behind and above the subject to create separation between the subject in the shot and the background. This basic lighting technique can be applied in almost every scene you shoot, which is why it is important to keep an open mind and to continue experimenting with possible light setups.</p><h3 id="Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging-2"><a href="#Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging-2" class="headerlink" title="Watch Video!

Set your translucent reflector, or other screen, up in front of your main light to diffuse it.</p><p>If you are hosting a <strong>beauty vlog</strong> then you might consider a slightly different set up. Instead of having your main light off to one side set it up directly in front of you so your entire face is lit evenly. It is still a good idea to use fill lights in this set up to give you some dimension, and a backlight is even more essential for helping you stand out from the background. The even light hitting your face will also make you look flat if you do not use a backlight.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lighting-tips02.JPG"                      alt="lighting tips"                ></p><p>If you are using all of the lighting options available to you and your video still looks too dark then you can try brightening it by <strong>opening up the aperture of your camera</strong> lens&#x2F;setting a lower f-stop. Letting more light into your camera can help your footage look brighter, although you also run the risk of making things look overexposed&#x2F; washed out if you are not careful.</p><p>If you are stuck shooting in <strong>low light conditions</strong> it is best to use a lens with a wider aperture&#x2F;lower f-stop.

Viewers find poor lighting distracting and it’s hard for them to see how great your content is if they are busy thinking about why your video is so dark. By creating a great lighting set up you can ensure that the people watching your videos are only thinking about how much they’re enjoying them.</p><p>Going outside and using natural light is the cheapest way to get a lot of light for your videos.

Loop is similar to traditional YouTube videos, but it can be played on a TV screen like a traditional TV show. Loop is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your content. It’s like a one-stop shop for all your content needs. You can use it to promote your latest video series.</p><p>Why <strong>looping YouTube videos on a TV</strong> is a great idea? First, it can be a fun way to watch your favorite videos without having to worry about the time. Second, it can be a way to save money on your cable. By watching your favorite videos on loop, you can cut down on the number of times you need to watch them.</p><p>If you are watching a series of videos, for example, looping them can help you to remember what happened in each one. Secondly, it can help you to learn new information more easily. If you are watching a tutorial or a video about a new topic, looping can help you to remember the details better.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                ></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Create-a-Loop-Video-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Create-a-Loop-Video-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Create a Loop Video for YouTube"></a>Part 1: How to Create a Loop Video for YouTube</h2><p>There is a lot of debate around whether or not creating a loop video is necessary for success on YouTube. Some people believe that it’s not necessary, while others believe that it is a must. The main benefit of creating a loop video is that it helps to keep your audience engaged. It also helps to create a sense of continuity between your videos.</p><p>Creating a loop video for your YouTube channel increases engagement because viewers can watch the video over and over again. This can lead to more clicks on your ads, which can lead to more revenue. It can also increase your subscribers and views. Maybe some people want to watch the same video multiple times in a row without having to keep pressing the play button on the remote.</p><p><strong>Filmora is the best video loop editor:</strong></p><p>If you need a powerful video editing tool that will let you create high-quality clips with multiple loops, look no further than <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

DSLR cameras require enough space inside for an angled mirror to flip up out of the way.</p><p>If your video shooting style is more on-the-go, like that of a daily vlogger or travel vlogger, the smaller size and lighter weight of a mirrorless camera may be more suitable for you.</p><h4 id="Previewing-Images"><a href="#Previewing-Images" class="headerlink" title="Previewing Images"></a>Previewing Images</h4><p>When you’re using a DSLR camera, your optical viewfinder will show you exactly what your camera sees as opposed to a digital preview of what your image sensor picks up.

People cannot click on something that does not come up in their search results.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Orderly-Quest-for-Veiled-YouTube-Vaults"><a href="#The-Orderly-Quest-for-Veiled-YouTube-Vaults" class="headerlink" title="The Orderly Quest for Veiled YouTube Vaults"></a>The Orderly Quest for Veiled YouTube Vaults</h2><p>You may have noticed that some videos in your YouTube playlist are unavailable. This is because the platform allows content creators to categorize their videos into public, private, or unlisted based on their preferences.</p><p>To help you uncover the content that you otherwise wouldn’t have access to, we’ve compiled a detailed guide to show you how to find YouTube hidden videos. We’ve also explained why so many unlisted videos are now labeled as private.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><h2 id="4-Types-of-Videos-on-YouTube"><a href="#4-Types-of-Videos-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="4 Types of Videos on YouTube"></a>4 Types of Videos on YouTube</h2><p>Firstly, let’s learn about the background of the types of YouTube videos. YouTube videos fall into the following four broad categories:</p><p><strong>Public Videos:</strong> YouTube contains videos on many themes and topics. It makes it impossible to watch all uploaded content under a specific category.</p><p>So, whenever you search for a video or theme, a list of content is displayed in the search result: “<strong>Public</strong> <strong>Videos</strong>.” It means that they are visible to everyone around the globe (depending on the terms and conditions). Moreover, you can share, like, unlike, download, or add these videos to your playlists for later watching.</p><p><strong>Private Videos</strong>: Private videos on YouTube can only be seen by people invited by the person who uploaded the video. This means that only those with access to the video’s shareable link can watch it.</p><p>Private videos are not visible to the public or to people who are not logged into YouTube. Hence, it is a great way to share sensitive or personal information with a select group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-on-youtube.png"                      alt="private video on youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Unlisted Video</strong> Unlisted videos on YouTube are not publicly visible on the site. They can only be seen by people who have the URL. This category works as a bridge between private and public videos. It is accessible only through sharable links without appealing in any YouTube public playlist or search result.</p><p>You might upload an unlisted video to YouTube if you do not want everyone to see it. However, you still want to share it with specific people, like your friends or family.

YouTube videos fall into the following four broad categories:</p><p><strong>Public Videos:</strong> YouTube contains videos on many themes and topics. It makes it impossible to watch all uploaded content under a specific category.</p><p>So, whenever you search for a video or theme, a list of content is displayed in the search result: “<strong>Public</strong> <strong>Videos</strong>.” It means that they are visible to everyone around the globe (depending on the terms and conditions). Moreover, you can share, like, unlike, download, or add these videos to your playlists for later watching.</p><p><strong>Private Videos</strong>: Private videos on YouTube can only be seen by people invited by the person who uploaded the video. This means that only those with access to the video’s shareable link can watch it.</p><p>Private videos are not visible to the public or to people who are not logged into YouTube. Hence, it is a great way to share sensitive or personal information with a select group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-on-youtube.png"                      alt="private video on youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Unlisted Video</strong> Unlisted videos on YouTube are not publicly visible on the site. They can only be seen by people who have the URL. This category works as a bridge between private and public videos. It is accessible only through sharable links without appealing in any YouTube public playlist or search result.</p><p>You might upload an unlisted video to YouTube if you do not want everyone to see it. However, you still want to share it with specific people, like your friends or family. You might also use an unlisted video to test out a new idea before making it public on the video-sharing platform.</p><p><strong>Age-Restricted Videos</strong>: Age-restricted videos on YouTube are not suitable for all audiences. It may contain content that includes violence, profanity, sexual content, and other inappropriate material. YouTube requires that users be at least 18 years old to view these types of videos.</p><p>If you search on YouTube and come across an age-restricted video, you will be asked to confirm your age before viewing its content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/age-restricted-videos-on-youtube.png"                      alt="age restricted video on youtube"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-3"><a href="#How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos"></a>How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now that we’ve learned about the four types of YouTube content, let’s discuss how you can find unlisted YouTube videos:</p><h3 id="How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-3"><a href="#How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?"></a>How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?</h3><p>Since <strong>unavailable videos in YouTube playlists are hidden</strong> from general public viewers, you cannot find them on YouTube or Google search results.</p><p>However, the following workaround can help you watch these YouTube videos without facing much trouble:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://unlistedvideos.com/" >Unlisted Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website.

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead></table><p>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                >       | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em> |<br>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                >         | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |</p><p>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                > | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em>                                                                                                                             |</p><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging.

The camera you use to record your daily vlogs doesn’t have to be the best camera on the market. It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead></table><p>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                >       | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em> |<br>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                >         | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |</p><p>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                > | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em>                                                                                                                             |</p><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-Playlist-Sharing-on-YouTube"><a href="#Mastering-Playlist-Sharing-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Mastering Playlist Sharing on YouTube"></a>Mastering Playlist Sharing on YouTube</h2><p>YouTube has become the most popular video-sharing platform on the internet, with users from all over the world uploading and watching videos daily. You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.</p><p>But what if you’ve created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we’ve put together an extensive guide on <strong>how to</strong> <strong>share a YouTube playlist</strong> on your computer and mobile devices.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><h2 id="Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work"><a href="#Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work" class="headerlink" title="Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?"></a>Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s figure out why the “Share” function doesn’t work. The “Share” function in the playlist does not work because it is set to “private,” and YouTube doesn’t allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938141">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938141.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938141">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938141.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938141%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938141/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, the <strong>YouTube view monetization programs are</strong> not that clear. Most people don’t even know how YouTube monetization views work. How many views on YouTube do you need to start making money from your content on the platform? Some people have even been made to believe the common misconception that views alone determine the amount of money a YouTuber earns. Let’s have a look at what entails views for YouTube monetization and the factors that affect your earnings on the platform.</p><p><strong>YouTube Channel Grower</strong> A cross-platform for enhancing and editing YouTube videos for more engagement!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money"></a><strong>Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money</strong></h2><p>Despite a lot of people seeking a successful career on YouTube, only a handful make it big on the platform. Some of the big names like Mr. Beast have proven how lucrative YouTube can be with the right following. However, for newcomers or beginners, succeeding on YouTube is a challenging feat.</p><p>The most burning question is how many monetized views on YouTube do you need to make money? A great deal of creators are still aiming to monetize YouTube views. Let’s have a look at what YouTube monetization review time involves and the views that get paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-1.JPG"                      alt="how many views to earn on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization"><a href="#Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization"></a><strong>Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization</strong></h3><p>Ideally, you will start earning ad revenue on YouTube for every 100 views on your videos. This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View"></a><strong>Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View</strong></h2><p>The amount of money that YouTubers make may seem complex to understand. Does YouTube pay per view? Yes, but not per video view. YouTube will pay you for views that appear on your channels. The actual revenue will depend on several factors.</p><ul><li><a href="#factor1">Factors Affecting Earnings per View</a></li><li><a href="#factor2">YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</a></li><li><a href="#factor3">Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</a></li><li><a href="#factor4">Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</a></li></ul><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting Earnings per View"></a><strong>Factors Affecting Earnings per View</strong></h3><p>The amount of money YouTubers make per view is affected by various factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Ad Revenue Rates</strong>: The rates vary depending on the country where viewers are located, the time of the year, and the ad your YouTube channel is running.</li><li><strong>Audience Demographics</strong>: Advertisers usually pay more to show their ads to viewers in some demographics, especially those who are interested in specific products or have a high income.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement</strong>: Videos with high CTR and AVD earn more income from ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time</strong>: YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time earn more money.</li></ul><h3 id="YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model"><a href="#YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model" class="headerlink" title="YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model"></a><strong>YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</strong></h3><p>The YouTibe’s revenue-sharing model determines how much creators are paid. The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers. This is because viewers will be engaged for longer periods, increasing their chances of viewing the ad.</li></ul><h3 id="Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube"><a href="#Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Other Revenue Streams on YouTube"></a><strong>Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</strong></h3><p>You can earn a lot more per 1,000 views by influencing your viewers to buy products even before your channel gets monetized. Other ways of making money on YouTube include</p><ul><li>Selling branded merch or courses</li><li>YouTube Premium subscriber’s subscription fee</li><li>Recurring monthly payments by members for special benefits</li><li>Highlight fan’s messages in chat streams</li><li>Sponsorships by partnering with brands to promote their products or services</li><li>Affiliate marketing</li><li>Brand deals</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Editing-YouTube-Videos-for-YouTube-Monetization-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Editing-YouTube-Videos-for-YouTube-Monetization-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. **Editing YouTube Videos for YouTube Monetization with Filmora"></a><strong>Part 3.</strong> **Editing YouTube Videos for YouTube Monetization with Filmora</h2><p>Good content will increase audience engagement and grow your YouTube channel.

Should I use a USB or XLR microphone for ASMR recordings?</h4><p>Although both USB and XLR microphones are frequently used to capture ASMR recordings, and XLR microphone produces a much better sound quality. So, if you want to prioritize the audio quality you should record all your ASMR videos with an XLR microphone.</p><p>However, there are quite a few affordable USB mics on the market that will enable you to capture sound in decent quality at a relatively low price.</p><h4 id="2-Which-type-of-microphone-should-be-used-to-record-ASMR-sounds"><a href="#2-Which-type-of-microphone-should-be-used-to-record-ASMR-sounds" class="headerlink" title="2.

Is an omnidirectional microphone better for ASMR than the binaural mic?</h4><p>The answer to this question depends on the type of ASMR video you want to create.

This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136615/26400" target="_top" id="2136615">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136615" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136615/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View</strong></h2><p>The amount of money that YouTubers make may seem complex to understand. Does YouTube pay per view? Yes, but not per video view. YouTube will pay you for views that appear on your channels. The actual revenue will depend on several factors.</p><ul><li><a href="#factor1">Factors Affecting Earnings per View</a></li><li><a href="#factor2">YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</a></li><li><a href="#factor3">Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</a></li><li><a href="#factor4">Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</a></li></ul><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting Earnings per View"></a><strong>Factors Affecting Earnings per View</strong></h3><p>The amount of money YouTubers make per view is affected by various factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Ad Revenue Rates</strong>: The rates vary depending on the country where viewers are located, the time of the year, and the ad your YouTube channel is running.</li><li><strong>Audience Demographics</strong>: Advertisers usually pay more to show their ads to viewers in some demographics, especially those who are interested in specific products or have a high income.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement</strong>: Videos with high CTR and AVD earn more income from ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time</strong>: YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time earn more money.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129042/19576" target="_top" id="2129042">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129042" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129042/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model"><a href="#YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model" class="headerlink" title="YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model"></a><strong>YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</strong></h3><p>The YouTibe’s revenue-sharing model determines how much creators are paid. The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers. This is because viewers will be engaged for longer periods, increasing their chances of viewing the ad.</li></ul><h3 id="Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube"><a href="#Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Other Revenue Streams on YouTube"></a><strong>Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</strong></h3><p>You can earn a lot more per 1,000 views by influencing your viewers to buy products even before your channel gets monetized.

Subtitles are useful to viewers who have hearing impairments, whose first language is different from yours, or who are unable to watch your video with sound. Closed captioning can also be useful for you as a YouTuber because it helps with your SEO, or search engine optimization. Practicing better SEO can get your videos ranked higher in search results. Google and YouTube both index subtitles and transcripts much like they do your video’s description, unless you use automated captions.</p><p>This article will first explain how you can turn on subtitles for the videos you watch and then walk you through adding captions to your own videos.</p><h2 id="How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How To Turn On Captions on YouTube"></a>How To Turn On Captions on YouTube</h2><p>In order for you to be able to view subtitles for a YouTube video the uploader of the video will need to have added them, unless you change your account settings to display automatic captions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/captions-how-to-turn-on.JPG"                      alt="captions"                ></p><p>To toggle subtitles on and off click on the Closed Captioning icon in the bottom right of your video player.</p><p>If the creator of the video has not added captions then you can enable automatic captions by going into your <strong>Account Settings</strong> and selecting <strong>Playback</strong>. Check the box next to <strong>Always Show Captions</strong>, and then check   <strong>Show Automatic Captions by Speech Recognition</strong>. These captions may be flawed, but you will still be able to see the more accurate user submitted captions on videos that have them. The <strong>Always Show Captions</strong> feature may be useful not only to the hearing impaired, but to users who do not speak the same language as the video producer.</p><p>If you want to change the language of the subtitles click on the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear) next to the closed captioning icon and choose your language next to   <strong>Subtitles&#x2F;CC</strong> . If the language you want is not there select <strong>Auto-Translate</strong>  and then pick a language. Google Translate will be used to generate subtitles in your chosen language.</p><h2 id="Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps"><a href="#Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps"></a>Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to <strong>Video Manager</strong> in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> and then look at your videos. Decide which one you want to add captions to.</p><p>2. Click on the drop-down menu next to the video you want to add captions to and choose <strong>Subtitles and CC</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Add New</strong> <strong>Subtitles or CC</strong>.</p><p>4. Choose whether to create your captions, upload a file that has them, transcribe your video, use automatic captioning, or use captioning software.</p><p><strong>Create Subtitles or Closed Captions</strong> will allow you to create your subtitles on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Upload A File</strong> allows you to upload a pre-made subtitle file from your computer. Supported file types include SubRip (.srt) and SubViewer (.sbv). You cannot use a word or PDF document for your subtitles.</p><p><strong>Transcribe and Set Timings</strong> is where you can type a transcript of your video and set timings to sync it to your video. This differs from Create Subtitles or Closed Captions in that your transcript is all typed in to one text field.</p><p><strong>Use Automatic Captioning</strong> will automatically use speech recognition technology to create captions. You can edit these auto-generated captions later if there are mistakes.</p><p><strong>Use Captioning Software or Services</strong> is what you choose if you want to use a program or service to create the subtitles for your video.</p><p>The easiest way to add subtitles to your videos is to use <strong>Automatic Captioning</strong>. However, Automatic Captioning is imperfect and may result in your viewers getting a sloppy, skewed, interpretation of your video. Automatic captions are also not indexed by YouTube and Google the way subtitles you create or upload are. This means that they will not have any value to your SEO strategy. If you do not input your own captions or transcript you are missing out on an opportunity for better search engine rankings. Automatic Captions are great if you do not have time to input subtitles and need a temporary solution, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>By captioning your YouTube videos you help to make them accessible to more potential viewers.

What’s the ideal YouTube thumbnail Size and Dimension?</strong></h2><p>An essential thing that every YouTube video developer needs to know is about the selection of the right side of the thumbnail for any video. As per the guidelines circulated by Google itself, the most appropriate size for the thumbnail image is 1280x720 pixels, where the recommended minimal pixel width is 640 pixels. Generally, the 16:9 ratio is considered as an ideal choice for Most of YouTube previews and players.</p><p>Here is one interesting thing that you need to know; the thumbnail of videos appears smaller during searches, but it naturally grows to the full size of a video during suggestions.
