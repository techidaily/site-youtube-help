The Switch is one of Nintendo’s best-selling devices ever, despite hardware that lags behind the competition in terms of power. The Switch Lite builds on that success with similar hardware, complete compatibility, and an even more portable form factor.</p><p> Where the original Switch is a hybrid portable console, the Switch Lite is a more traditional handheld gaming device. It still provides most of the best features of the full-sized Switch, but it’s also Nintendo’s only pure portable since the discontinuation of the 3DS family of handhelds.</p><p> Although I appreciate what Nintendo has done here with the Lite, a few key missing features might not make it the optimal choice for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/EUqklfDyxuB1ye8-DBboDrjzkUw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-2-225f5107c7b74f159afecba8c3f6174a.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134218/18498" target="_top" id="2134218">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134218" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134218/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130889/7443" target="_top" id="2130889">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130889" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130889/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Cute-and-compact"><a href="#Design-Cute-and-compact" class="headerlink" title="Design: Cute and compact"></a><strong>Design: Cute and compact</strong></h2><p> It’s hard not to swoon at the sight of the Switch Lite. The handheld console is cute and compact, featuring unique color options, bright white buttons, and joysticks wrapped around a downsized screen. The whole unit is about the size of a beefy phablet. The screen alone is about the size of an iPhone SE.</p><p> Compared to its larger cousin, this device is light and slim, with a smooth matte surface that spills across the entire unit in a beautiful, uninterrupted fashion. Whereas the regular Switch creates a stark contrast between each Joy-Con and the console, the Lite is one continuous body that creates a sleeker look and sturdier feel.</p><p> Looking at both Switches side-by-side, the Lite isn’t massively smaller in comparison, but it seems that way when you swap between the two. The reduction in size and weight doesn’t make it challenging to use for those with larger hands.</p><p> The screen has been decreased from 6.2 inches to 5.5 inches, still sporting the same plastic overlay above it (meaning you’ll want to get a glass protector to prevent scratches), and the length and height have been trimmed down a good bit. The most obvious change here is the overall length of the Lite, which is slimmer by roughly the size of an entire Joy-Con on one side.</p><p> The smaller size is because the regular Switch has removable controllers, and the Lite does not. The compromise on its size is that you can’t take your Joy-Cons off and instantly start playing a local multiplayer game. Although that might be disappointing for some, the Lite now feels much better for long handheld gaming sessions when compared to the bulkier model.</p><p> Although I appreciate what Nintendo has done here with the Lite, a few key missing features might not make it the optimal choice for everyone.</p><p> Aside from the lack of removable controllers, the Lite features the same layout as the Joy-Con inputs, down to the spacing and functions. On the left are two shoulder buttons, a minus button (select), a joystick, a directional pad, and a screenshot button. The right side is mostly the same, with two more shoulders, a plus button (start), four inputs, another joystick, and a home button.</p><p> The only real notable difference here is that Nintendo has opted for a traditional D-pad, which is leagues better than the old layout for platformers, fighting games, and pretty much everything else. This distinction is, of course, because you’ll no longer be removing the left controller and requiring it to function as a separate device.</p><p> The top is home to the power button and volume toggle, a vent, a 3.5mm jack, and the game card slot, while the bottom holds the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> input for power and the addition of a new standalone SD card slot.</p><p> Where there’s usually a kickstand on the Switch with a hidden SD card slot, this version drops that option (since you can no longer remove the Joy-Con for tabletop mode) and adds a small door for expanding your storage. The kickstand was flimsy anyway, so you likely won’t miss it.</p><p> There’s still the issue with the USB-C port sticking straight out of the bottom, making it hard to sit flat against something, but this is somewhat less annoying since you’ll likely be holding it while gaming. Unfortunately, the Lite does not fit into the dock that came with a Switch. If you want to charge it, you have to plug it directly into the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-c-chargers-4155815" >USB-C charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the one on a regular Switch, as they’re the same.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7502vZ1Vh2D4nRux6hEnq4BL3Rk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-5-2fb7aa309cc54dd79c07bd799ef7fe84.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151888/7443" target="_top" id="2151888">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151888" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151888/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915825/19272" target="_top" id="1915825">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915825" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915825/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Hit-the-switch"><a href="#Setup-Process-Hit-the-switch" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Hit the switch"></a><strong>Setup Process: Hit the switch</strong></h2><p> If you’ve set up a previous Switch console in the past, the process here is mostly the same, but it’s even easier since there are no Joy-Cons.</p><p> Since the Lite is exclusively handheld, there’s no dock to worry about here, but make sure your console has enough juice before beginning setup. Setup starts with pushing the power button on the top and is facilitated by an on-screen guide that helps you set up the usual stuff like Wi-Fi, account creation (or login), etc. When complete, either pop in a game card or download one digitally to begin gaming.</p><p> Things get trickier if you have an existing Nintendo account that you want to use with both the Switch Lite and an older Switch. The good news is that you can, but the bad news is that Nintendo doesn’t make it super convenient.</p><p> When you link your Nintendo account during setup, you can choose which Switch you want to be your primary system and which will be your secondary. That means that Nintendo essentially makes you decide to set up the Switch Lite as a secondary system that can only play your games while logged in and connected to Wi-Fi, or you can transfer the old Switch’s data to the new one.</p><p> Things get trickier if you have an existing Nintendo account that you want to use with both the Switch Lite and an older Switch. The good news is that you can, but the bad news is that Nintendo doesn’t make it super convenient.</p><p> If you opt to make your Lite the secondary, you can kiss goodbye to playing any of your digital games on the go unless you have stable Wi-Fi on hand. Because of this, I decided to make my docked Switch the secondary (since it is always at home with Wi-Fi access).</p><p> While this does solve most of the issues, it’s annoying that it forces you to choose. Other systems, like Xbox, only allow one “home” console to play your games without being logged in, but it’s less of an issue since those consoles aren’t portable.</p><p> Another thorn in the side here is that your saved data is local, and if you want to save data to the cloud, you will have to pay for Nintendo’s online service (thankfully, it’s cheap). However, none of this data migration will happen automatically like other gaming consoles. You’ll need to manually download your saves locally each time and then update them on the console you want to use, even with the cloud option.</p><p> Sure, all of this does work, but it’s a pain to do and feels like another shortsighted attempt from Nintendo in a world where other competitors are leagues ahead. With other consoles and PC platforms like Steam, your saved data syncs to the cloud automatically, allowing you to play wherever you want without worrying about losing progress.</p><p> There’s yet another issue if you have kids or multiple accounts on your Switches. Since one Switch is now set as your primary, other users can’t access all your games from a secondary console.</p><p> For example, if you set the Switch Lite as your primary system, nobody can play games you’ve bought and downloaded on your home Switch unless they log into your account. You could always keep that other Switch as your primary, but then your Switch Lite will need Wi-Fi to access titles. It’s easy to see the problem there, but apparently, Nintendo doesn’t.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kQx9K3tATPBWAMgyJJymqBqYPao=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-3-7349fa7d79f34dbaa50c25cb59aec820.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118322/7443" target="_top" id="2118322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118322/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043617/7443" target="_top" id="2043617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043617/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Decent-for-mobile-gaming-but-no-FHD"><a href="#Performance-Decent-for-mobile-gaming-but-no-FHD" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent for mobile gaming, but no FHD"></a><strong>Performance: Decent for mobile gaming, but no FHD</strong></h2><p> Much like the original Switch, the Lite is by no means a powerhouse console sporting top-of-the-line graphics and hardware. That said, it doesn’t necessarily need to be. The Switch Lite performs similarly to its larger counterpart while in handheld mode, but let’s delve into specifics.</p><p> Sporting the same custom Tegra X1 from Nvidia, the Switch Lite has plenty of CPU and GPU power for its humble needs. The screen maxes out at a 720p resolution, which isn’t great but gets the job done on such a small screen. Since you can’t use the Switch Lite with a dock, there’s no way to play in 1080p.</p><p> Although the screen is reduced from 6.2 inches to 5.5 inches on the Lite, I didn’t notice a big difference. The Lite’s display packs more pixels per inch (PPI) at 267 PPI compared to the original Switch’s 236 PPI. The display looks sharper, but with such a marginal difference, most won’t notice much.</p><p> I’ve played many games on the Switch Lite, including modern classics like<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review-4685759" >The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Pokémon Let’s Go, and Shovel Knight. All these had a solid performance from the console, with no considerable dips in frames, hiccups, or freezes.</p><p> Like its predecessor’s mobile mode, the Switch Lite is unfortunately capped at 30 FPS for many titles (though it can hit 60 in some single-player games). Unlike the Switch, which you can dock to boost performance, you’re stuck with the handheld specs on the Lite.</p><p> A quick example is that single-player Mario Kart 8 Deluxe runs at a smooth 60 FPS in 1080p on a docked Switch but 720p at 60 FPS in the handheld mode. Adding more players reduces your frames to 30 FPS, which is also true for Smash Bros. The Switch Lite isn’t designed for single-device multiplayer, though, and you’re unlikely to get three or more players all crouched behind the 5.5-inch screen anyway.</p><p> These somewhat disappointing performance numbers look bad compared to a home console but remember that this is a handheld console that you can play for hours on end without needing a power cable.</p><p> If you’re like me and love to use the previous Switch in handheld mode for single-player games, the Lite will quickly become your go-to Switch for this particular setting. I’d even argue that this is perhaps the ideal way you should use it.</p><p> Another thorn in the side here is that your saved data is local, and if you want to save data to the cloud, you will have to pay for Nintendo’s online service (thankfully, it’s cheap).</p><p> Since the Switch Lite doesn’t have detachable Joy-Cons, you’ll need to bring an extra controller if you want to play local multiplayer games on the go. It works the same way as the original console, but it’s far less practical on the Lite since you can’t dock it, it doesn’t have a kickstand, you need separate controllers, and the screen is smaller. The option is there if you want, but this isn’t the Switch for you if you want to do local multiplayer.</p><p> Online multiplayer does, however, work pretty well. Boot up a game like Super Mario Party, Super Smash Bros., or your favorite free-to-play shooter and connect to the internet just like you would on the original Switch. For most matchmaking, however, you’ll need to pick up Nintendo’s online subscription service<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nintendo-switch-online-4175784" >Nintendo Switch Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> This service is inexpensive at just $20 a year (or $35 a year for a family plan that allows up to eight users, also available at $4 a month), but many remain frustrated with its capabilities. It includes cool perks, like access to a growing library of NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and Sega Genesis games, the Nintendo Switch Online smartphone app, Save Data Cloud, and special offers for members.</p><p> Once again, there’s no Ethernet port, so you can stick with Wi-Fi and hope for the best or grab an aftermarket adapter, which is far less practical on the Lite, seeing how it’s handheld only.</p><p> Online games have worked well for me, despite needing to rely on Wi-Fi. However, Nintendo’s online service is still far behind the likes of Sony or Microsoft, and the lack of a wired connection means you may run into issues with speed and stability if your Wi-Fi isn’t great.</p><p> Frustrations like the lack of in-game chat cripple the Nintendo Switch Online, and Nintendo has done little to address these issues. Many functions still require you to use the app on your smartphone (like online voice chat), and while Xbox and PlayStation users get free games for their consoles as part of their subscription services, Switch users only get older virtual console games.</p><p> All said and done, the performance is excellent for single-player experiences on the Switch Lite, with online multiplayer trailing behind but perfectly functional. Local multiplayer is easily one of the biggest strengths of the original Switch and our favorite aspect. However, the methods used to create a more portable console with the Lite also severely hurt its viability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KxMaFgooi4rm3qbImmLKatuUtVI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-4-ef84dbbbde3d48ff97515e5c6b9981a4.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Software-Still-a-bit-drab-but-smooth-and-snappy"><a href="#Software-Still-a-bit-drab-but-smooth-and-snappy" class="headerlink" title="Software: Still a bit drab, but smooth and snappy"></a><strong>Software: Still a bit drab, but smooth and snappy</strong></h2><p> If you’ve got an older Switch already or at least spent some time with one, the software found on the Switch Lite is exactly the same. Thankfully, that means it’s clean and snappy, but also a bit boring.</p><p> Booting up your Switch takes you to a quick start screen that allows you to either jump back into your recently used game or go straight to the main home screen by pressing the home button. This home screen provides a horizontal scrolling line of tiles for your games and apps, arranged by what you’ve recently used. Moving down to the lower row provides access to stuff like news, the eShop, screenshots, controller settings or the console’s settings.</p><p> Although you likely won’t be using Joy-Cons too often with the Lite, the bottom right will display your current controller setup so you know what’s connected. There’s also a handy little guide for what buttons you can use to interact with the options on screen. Up top, your profile and friends list can be accessed alongside a clock, a Wi-Fi meter, and a battery gauge.</p><p> Despite being stripped of some of the Switch’s more unique features and strengths, the Switch Lite is a perfect console for gamers on the go or those who prefer handheld.</p><p> While the overall UI is quick and navigable, it feels drab. There are still no themes to swap aside from a simple light or dark mode, so don’t get too lofty with your customization ideas.</p><p> The biggest strength of the UI might be that you can use the touchscreen for most functions outside of games. Navigating the screen by tapping elements is even easier than using the controllers, and having an on-screen keyboard means typing out names and info is as easy as texting on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eFyBn6jL7cdHOO4q7zc6pALdQzw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-6-42a5bc5ea4e544bdb6d3fbbd074583c2.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Battery-Life-Slightly-better-but-not-the-best"><a href="#Battery-Life-Slightly-better-but-not-the-best" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: Slightly better, but not the best"></a><strong>Battery Life: Slightly better, but not the best</strong></h2><p> Battery life on the original Switch was just okay, to put it lightly, but typically you were lucky to get anything over 3 hours of screen time with most titles. It eventually received a bigger battery in a minor hardware revision, which helped. The Switch Lite has a slightly smaller battery than the revised Switch but also has lower power needs due to its small screen.</p><p> The Lite comes equipped with a 3,570mAh lithium-ion battery (compared to the 4,310mAh on the first Switch) that promises 3 to 7 hours of runtime. That extensive range exists because some activities on the console are far less demanding than others.</p><p> This slight bump in battery life is primarily due to the Switch Lite’s smaller screen, which needs less juice. Charging the battery takes about three hours, but only if you drain it completely. Using it occasionally instead of for extended gaming sessions, I’ve found that I don’t need to charge it that often and that it charges fast when I do.</p><p> Demanding titles like Breath of the Wild will still place you on the shorter end of that battery life spectrum, but I could log about 3.5-4 hours even with Zelda. Indie games and others that are less power-hungry can get you up to 5 hours and above. Note that you can tweak settings like brightness, Wi-Fi, and airplane mode to give even more screen time.</p><p> A portable charger is still one of the best accessories you can pick up for the Switch, and there are many quality options out that are approved by Nintendo. I recommend picking one up, but be careful which one you choose. I’ve stuck with reputable brands and haven’t had any trouble, but I have heard horror stories from people who have bricked their consoles with unsupported options.</p><p> Lastly, the battery is internal, so you can’t easily pop in a new one when it starts to degrade. While I haven’t seen any degradation with mine, it’ll happen at some point. When it does, sending it to Nintendo for repair is the only real option.</p><h2 id="Price-Inexpensive-console-gaming-in-your-hands"><a href="#Price-Inexpensive-console-gaming-in-your-hands" class="headerlink" title="Price: Inexpensive console gaming in your hands"></a><strong>Price: Inexpensive console gaming in your hands</strong></h2><p> It’s no surprise that since Nintendo removed many features from the Switch to create the Lite model, the price has also decreased considerably. The Switch is already at a pretty sweet price of $300, so how does the Lite stack up?</p><p> The Switch Lite has an MSRP of $200, which is a pretty good value. It plays all the same games as the original Switch at a significantly lower price and is much more portable. You do lose the ability to dock it; for some people, that feature will be worth the extra $100.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7XA6hgAK2B4hDSlWdmB8VQddrjw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-7-Comparison-44dcf88ec51247a2b0756445a3c7884d.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Nintendo-Switch-Lite-vs-Nintendo-Switch"><a href="#Nintendo-Switch-Lite-vs-Nintendo-Switch" class="headerlink" title="Nintendo Switch Lite vs. Nintendo Switch"></a><strong>Nintendo Switch Lite vs. Nintendo Switch</strong></h2><p> The biggest competitor to the Switch Lite is the original Switch. Nintendo has done an excellent job with both of these devices, but they each have some strengths and weaknesses you should consider before buying.</p><p> The first thing to consider is whether you want to play couch co-op or versus with your friends. If you plan to use your Switch primarily for playing Mario Party or Smash Bros. with a bunch of your friends on the couch—get the regular Switch. You need the original Switch to play on a larger screen, and it also comes with two Joy-Cons that you can use as separate controllers.</p><p> Even if you wanted to play with one other person locally on your Switch Lite, you’d need to spend about $60-70 on some Joy-Cons or a Pro Controller, thus nearly reaching the price of the full-sized console.</p><p> If you plan to use your Switch primarily for stuff like playing Mario Party or Smash Bros. with a bunch of your friends on the couch—get the regular Switch.</p><p> If you feel like you’ll use your Switch away from home, or you’re primarily a solo player who plans to focus on single-player games or online multiplayer, the Switch Lite is equally good here. The main difference is that the Lite can only be used in handheld mode and takes a slight hit in resolution. The strengths of the Switch Lite are that it’s ultra-compact and portable, so if you mainly want something to take with you from place to place, it’s the better bet.</p><p> The Switch Lite also makes a great companion device if you already have a Switch. If you have both, you get the best of both worlds—the Lite’s portability and the regular Switch’s extra features.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Perfect for gamers who prefer handheld.</strong></p><p> Despite being stripped of some of the Switch’s more unique features and strengths, the Switch Lite is a perfect console for gamers on the go or those who prefer handheld. It features an extensive library of exclusives that are perfect for a highly mobile system like Animal Crossing—and it’s hard to argue with the price.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-review-one-power-packed-4k-console-5088039" >Xbox Series X Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-series-s-review-5085770" >Xbox Series S Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >Sony PlayStation 5 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Switch Lite</li><li>Product Brand  Nintendo</li><li>UPC  070004640519</li><li>Price  $199.99</li><li>Weight  9.7 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.6 x 8.2 x 0.55 in.</li><li>Warranty  1-year warranty</li><li>CPU  Nvidia Custom Tegra X1</li><li>GPU  Nvidia Custom Tegra X1</li><li>RAM  4GB</li><li>Storage  32GB internal, one micro SD slot (up to 2TB)</li><li>Ports  USB-C, 3.5mm audio jack</li><li>Screen  Multi-touch capacitive touchscreen &#x2F;

Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool to Get Tags"></a>1. Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool to Get Tags</h3><p>YouTube’s search engine can be your best ally on the quest for great tags. This tool was created to aid users who are looking for content on the platform, and content creators can benefit from it as well. By typing the general topic of your video, or a few words vaguely related to your video, into the search bar on YouTube you can see suggestions that reflect what viewers are searching for and take some of those suggestions into consideration for your tags. With every new phrase (and even every additional character you type), new options will appear. By playing around with this tool you will gain valuable insight into the searching habits of YouTube viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-tag-by-searching.jpg"                      alt="Find YouTube Video Tag"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137394/7443" target="_top" id="2137394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This method may not be too precise, but the idea is to quickly gather information and perhaps get some inspiration for more creative or complex tags. Most of the suggestions will be logical, but there can be a few unexpected combinations you’d never think of. Be very careful when translating the findings to your own situation, since the fact that some terms are popular doesn’t mean they are relevant for your video. Another problem is that slightly altered terminology can significantly change the effectiveness of the tag, so you should ideally use the suggested phrases in the exact form as you found them or not at all. If you do make adjustments, you should test the new tag through the same auto-complete tool and see how it fares.</p><h3 id="2-Try-YouTube-Tag-Generators"><a href="#2-Try-YouTube-Tag-Generators" class="headerlink" title="2.  Try YouTube Tag Generators"></a>2.  Try YouTube Tag Generators</h3><p>If you’d like to dig a little deeper, there are multiple dedicated tools that can assist you in picking the most suitable YouTube tags for every video you upload. Let’s examine a few of them in greater detail:</p><h4 id="1-Keyword-Tool"><a href="#1-Keyword-Tool" class="headerlink" title="#1. Keyword Tool"></a>#1. Keyword Tool</h4><p>A very simple and reliable web-based tag generator that provides you with 750 frequently searched keywords that would be suitable for your video. The keyword list is based on YouTube’s search tool in a way similar to what we described in the previous chapter. However, since the analysis is automated with the Keyword Tool, you can get a huge list in just a few seconds. This generator is especially useful when you are looking for long-tail keywords that attract niche audiences.</p><h4 id="2-Rapid-Tags"><a href="#2-Rapid-Tags" class="headerlink" title="#2. Rapid Tags"></a>#2. Rapid Tags</h4><p>This tool is a bit more sophisticated and includes some analytic features on top of tag generating capacities, allowing you to manage your channel more effectively. It’s completely automated, so you won’t have to do any heavy lifting on your own. Just type the URL of your video into the appropriate field and let Rapid Tags do the rest. You can easily switch between the Generator, Analyzer, Ranker, and Tracker tools, so you can acquire a complete picture of the suitability of each tag and a better understanding of the projected performance of your video.</p><p>Want more tools to generate YouTube tags? Check our picks of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best YouTube video tag generators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="3-BetterWaytoWeb"><a href="#3-BetterWaytoWeb" class="headerlink" title="#3. BetterWaytoWeb"></a>#3. BetterWaytoWeb</h4><p>While this free-to-use tool has a very simple interface and won’t require any background knowledge to use, it still provides valuable information. It can suggest suitable tags for your new video based on the main keyword you provide, speeding up your research considerably. It can also analyze the tags placed on an existing YouTube video, which is important for deducing how other authors working in the same category are optimizing their content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948954/19272" target="_top" id="1948954">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948954" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948954/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Study-Your-YouTube-Rivals’-Tags"><a href="#3-Study-Your-YouTube-Rivals’-Tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Study Your YouTube Rivals’ Tags"></a>3. Study Your YouTube Rivals’ Tags</h3><p>YouTube content authors can learn a lot by analyzing their top competitors. No matter what your videos are about, there are probably countless other creators that want to attract the same audiences as you.

Striking a perfect balance between the visual and textual elements isn’t always easy, especially if the text is the only way to convey essential information to the audience.</p><p>Luckily, video editing and presentation software products offer the tools you will need to combine video and text. In this article, we are going to show you how to add a video to text in PowerPoint and Filmora.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Add-Video-to-Text-for-Free-with-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Add-Video-to-Text-for-Free-with-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Add Video to Text for Free with PowerPoint?"></a>Part 1: How to Add Video to Text for Free with PowerPoint?</h2><p>An effective PowerPoint presentation should contain proportionate amounts of textual and visual elements. Using too many images, videos or animations can make following a presentation difficult, just as too much text can render a presentation too static.</p><p>Adding videos to titles or subtitles you include in a slideshow you’re creating in PowerPoint can help you create a presentation that is both informative and visually entertaining. The process of combining videos with text in PowerPoint isn’t overly complicated, but you will still need to go through it several times in order to become familiar with it.</p><p>You should start by creating a new slide and adding a textbox to it. Proceed to type the word or phrase into the textbox and go on to format the text. Pick the font that matches the style of your presentation and make sure that the text size is large enough for the video to be visible.</p><p>Head over to the Insert tab, select Rectangle from the Shapes menu, and create a rectangular shape over the entire slide. Right-click on the slide and choose the Send to Back option from the menu. In this manner, you will position the rectangle you created behind the textbox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insert-rectangle-shape.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Powerpoint- insert shape"                ></p><p>The next step you will have to take is to create the cut-out of the text within the rectangle. Select both the text and shape you placed in the background before clicking on the Format tab that is located near the end of PowerPoint’s ribbon.</p><p>Find the Insert Shape option and choose Subtract from the Merge Shapes drop-down menu. The shape of the text in the textbox will be applied to the object in the background, which enables you to add a video to that text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtract-from-merge-shapes.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Powerpoint- substract"                ></p><p>Click on the Insert tab, and then choose the Video option from the Media menu. You can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >insert a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is stored on a local hard drive or the Internet to PowerPoint. The video will cover the entire slide, so you must right-click on it and select the Send to Back option.</p><p>You can then fine-tune the video playback settings from the Playback tab. Preview the results before you move on to the next slide in your presentation, and make necessary adjustments if you don’t like how the video merged with the text.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139109/17108" target="_top" id="2139109">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139109" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139109/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Adding-Video-to-Text-in-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-Adding-Video-to-Text-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Adding Video to Text in Filmora"></a>Part 2: Adding Video to Text in Filmora</h2><p>Besides presentation software, you can also use video editing software products to add a video to text.

When done, you should export the title as a video file, and then import it back into your project.</p><p>Now it’s time to add the text video and the background video to the project media library, and then place the two videos one above the other. Since we’re adding video to text, the text video should be placed above the background video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compositing-video-9.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Filmora9 Compositing"                ></p><p>Click on the video that contains text to gain access to the Video tab of the Editor panel and then expand the Compositing menu.

Two of the major differences between them are:</p><p>Annotations are not clickable on mobile devices.</p><p>You cannot choose the size or positioning of Cards.</p><p>This article will teach you about both Cards and Annotations and discuss the best uses for each of them.</p><p><strong>Part 1: Annotations</strong></p><p>Annotations are messages that float overtop of your videos in the YouTube player. Usually, annotations are clickable and take users to other content created by you.</p><p><strong>Section 1: Types of Annotations</strong></p><p>There are five types of YouTube annotations:</p><p><strong>Notes</strong> are colored boxes placed over the top of your videos.</p><p><strong>Speech Bubbles</strong> look like dialogue boxes in a comic strip. They have tails that you can adjust so it looks like one of the people in your video is saying what is written in the annotation.</p><p><strong>Spotlights</strong> have a subtle border and are completely clear inside. Your text only appears when a viewer’s cursor hovers over top of these annotations.</p><p><strong>Labels</strong> are like spotlights except that viewers do not have to hover over them for your text to be visible.</p><p>Any of these annotations can be used to link viewers to other videos, or as subscribe links. You can also add a simple <strong>Title</strong> to your video through the Annotations menu.</p><p><strong>Section 2: How to Use Annotations</strong></p><p>*Note: the above video mentions Pause annotations, which are no longer available.</p><p>Here are two of the best uses for annotations:</p><p><strong>Clickable End Cards &#x2F; Outros</strong></p><p>One of the best ways you can use spotlight annotations is to create clickable end cards for your videos.</p><p>When your video finishes playing the YouTube player will display a selection of suggested videos that might direct viewers away from your channel. You can keep more of these viewers watching your content by creating your own ‘suggested videos’ card and putting it at the end of your videos.</p><p>Put thumbnails of two or three of your other videos on your end card, or use ‘picture-in-picture’ to actually imbed footage from them. Then, after you upload your video, go in and place clickable spotlight annotations over top of your video thumbnails.</p><p>This is one use for annotations that cannot be duplicated with cards.</p><p><strong>Promoting Your Videos</strong></p><p>You should not wait until the end of your video to start linking viewers to other content. Many viewers will click away before they see your end card because your video is not exactly what they were looking for. By placing note or speech bubble annotations occasionally throughout your videos you can catch some of these people before they click off of your channel.</p><p>This works especially well if you link to videos on similar subjects to the one you are annotating.</p><p>Instead of just linking to another video of yours, try to link to that video on a playlist. Once a viewer is on a playlist your videos will auto-play after each other, which is good for both your view count and watch time.</p><p>You can also use the newer YouTube Cards for this, but Annotations might still be a better choice because viewers only need to click once vs. twice for Cards.</p><p>Try both and see which performs best for your channel. It might be in your best interest to keep on using both as they target different audiences – Cards are clickable on mobile devices, for example, but Annotations are not.</p><h4 id="Part-2-YouTube-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: YouTube Cards"></a><strong>Part 2: YouTube Cards</strong></h4><p>YouTube Cards are newer than annotations and a lot of people believe they will one day replace Annotations. While there are benefits to Cards – like embedding images to represent your links – you cannot choose the shape, size, or placement of them. This means they have limited uses.</p><p>When viewers click on a Card they are shown additional information and a thumbnail representing the page they will be taken to if they choose to click again. This extra step could be either help viewers decide to click your links or give them a second chance to decide they would rather not.</p><p><strong>Section 1: When to Use Cards</strong></p><p>A linked Annotation is simply a call to action viewers can click on.

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947750/11832" target="_top" id="947750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947750/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                >       | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system.

In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions.

It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above.

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging.

Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor.

In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                > | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em>                                                                                                                             |</p><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151892/7443" target="_top" id="2151892">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151892" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151892/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                > | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em>                                                                                                                             |</p><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

However, the <strong>YouTube view monetization programs are</strong> not that clear. Most people don’t even know how YouTube monetization views work. How many views on YouTube do you need to start making money from your content on the platform? Some people have even been made to believe the common misconception that views alone determine the amount of money a YouTuber earns. Let’s have a look at what entails views for YouTube monetization and the factors that affect your earnings on the platform.</p><p><strong>YouTube Channel Grower</strong> A cross-platform for enhancing and editing YouTube videos for more engagement!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money"></a><strong>Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money</strong></h2><p>Despite a lot of people seeking a successful career on YouTube, only a handful make it big on the platform. Some of the big names like Mr. Beast have proven how lucrative YouTube can be with the right following. However, for newcomers or beginners, succeeding on YouTube is a challenging feat.</p><p>The most burning question is how many monetized views on YouTube do you need to make money? A great deal of creators are still aiming to monetize YouTube views. Let’s have a look at what YouTube monetization review time involves and the views that get paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-1.JPG"                      alt="how many views to earn on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization"><a href="#Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization"></a><strong>Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization</strong></h3><p>Ideally, you will start earning ad revenue on YouTube for every 100 views on your videos. This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View"></a><strong>Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View</strong></h2><p>The amount of money that YouTubers make may seem complex to understand. Does YouTube pay per view? Yes, but not per video view. YouTube will pay you for views that appear on your channels. The actual revenue will depend on several factors.</p><ul><li><a href="#factor1">Factors Affecting Earnings per View</a></li><li><a href="#factor2">YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</a></li><li><a href="#factor3">Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</a></li><li><a href="#factor4">Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</a></li></ul><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting Earnings per View"></a><strong>Factors Affecting Earnings per View</strong></h3><p>The amount of money YouTubers make per view is affected by various factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Ad Revenue Rates</strong>: The rates vary depending on the country where viewers are located, the time of the year, and the ad your YouTube channel is running.</li><li><strong>Audience Demographics</strong>: Advertisers usually pay more to show their ads to viewers in some demographics, especially those who are interested in specific products or have a high income.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement</strong>: Videos with high CTR and AVD earn more income from ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time</strong>: YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time earn more money.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997680/19272" target="_top" id="1997680">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997680" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997680/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model"><a href="#YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model" class="headerlink" title="YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model"></a><strong>YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</strong></h3><p>The YouTibe’s revenue-sharing model determines how much creators are paid. The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers. This is because viewers will be engaged for longer periods, increasing their chances of viewing the ad.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080317/19272" target="_top" id="2080317">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080317" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080317/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube"><a href="#Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Other Revenue Streams on YouTube"></a><strong>Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</strong></h3><p>You can earn a lot more per 1,000 views by influencing your viewers to buy products even before your channel gets monetized.

The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money"></a><strong>Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money</strong></h2><p>Despite a lot of people seeking a successful career on YouTube, only a handful make it big on the platform. Some of the big names like Mr. Beast have proven how lucrative YouTube can be with the right following. However, for newcomers or beginners, succeeding on YouTube is a challenging feat.</p><p>The most burning question is how many monetized views on YouTube do you need to make money? A great deal of creators are still aiming to monetize YouTube views. Let’s have a look at what YouTube monetization review time involves and the views that get paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-1.JPG"                      alt="how many views to earn on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization-1"><a href="#Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization"></a><strong>Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization</strong></h3><p>Ideally, you will start earning ad revenue on YouTube for every 100 views on your videos. This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid-1"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid-1" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130871/7443" target="_top" id="2130871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money-1"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money-1" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View-1"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View"></a><strong>Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View</strong></h2><p>The amount of money that YouTubers make may seem complex to understand. Does YouTube pay per view? Yes, but not per video view. YouTube will pay you for views that appear on your channels. The actual revenue will depend on several factors.</p><ul><li><a href="#factor1">Factors Affecting Earnings per View</a></li><li><a href="#factor2">YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</a></li><li><a href="#factor3">Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</a></li><li><a href="#factor4">Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</a></li></ul><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View-1"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View-1" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting Earnings per View"></a><strong>Factors Affecting Earnings per View</strong></h3><p>The amount of money YouTubers make per view is affected by various factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Ad Revenue Rates</strong>: The rates vary depending on the country where viewers are located, the time of the year, and the ad your YouTube channel is running.</li><li><strong>Audience Demographics</strong>: Advertisers usually pay more to show their ads to viewers in some demographics, especially those who are interested in specific products or have a high income.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement</strong>: Videos with high CTR and AVD earn more income from ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time</strong>: YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time earn more money.</li></ul><h3 id="YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model-1"><a href="#YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model"></a><strong>YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</strong></h3><p>The YouTibe’s revenue-sharing model determines how much creators are paid. The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers-1"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers-1" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers. This is because viewers will be engaged for longer periods, increasing their chances of viewing the ad.</li></ul><h3 id="Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube-1"><a href="#Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Other Revenue Streams on YouTube"></a><strong>Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</strong></h3><p>You can earn a lot more per 1,000 views by influencing your viewers to buy products even before your channel gets monetized.

The scientific explanations of ASMR and the list of its potential causes of this reaction are not as extensive as they can be.</p><p>Moreover, the visual and audio content that is designed to trigger the ASMR is perceived as unusual which further contributes to the controversy associated with this genre of videos. You are at the right place if you would like to learn more about ASMR because in this article we are going to take you through all the things you need to know about ASMR.</p><h2 id="How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work-3"><a href="#How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="How Do ASMR Videos Work?"></a>How Do ASMR Videos Work?</h2><p>As strange as it may sound, millions of people around the globe are watching videos of someone whispering into a microphone, and apparently, it is helping them deal with stress, anxiety, and insomnia.</p><p>However, watching a video in any setting isn’t enough to trigger ASMR. You have to be in a quiet room and away from the everyday hustle in order to put yourself into the state of mind in which experiencing ASMR is possible. So, once you’ve found a comfortable position in a quiet room you can play an ASMR video.</p><p>The type of trigger the video’s host is going to use varies from one video to another because in one video they might just speak softly into a microphone or gently blow air into it, while in another they might produce sounds using plastic or metal objects.</p><p>Moreover, the ASMR triggers the video’s host is going to use also depend on the host because some hosts are predominantly focused on audio triggers, while others focus on visual ASMR triggers. Role-plays are also quite common for ASMR videos and you can easily end up seeing the hosts dressed up as librarians, doctors, or even tailors pretending to measure your dimensions.</p><p>As a form of synesthesia, ASMR is triggered by a role-play or a low speaking voice as the visual or audio stimuli is associated with a pleasant experience that originates from the top of the head and then spreads through the neck and back.</p><p>Ideally, such a video should get you in the state of calmness and slight euphoria which in turn should help you relax and relieve the stress you’re experiencing. Whether or not ASMR videos can achieve this goal is debatable.</p><h2 id="Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone-3"><a href="#Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone-3" class="headerlink" title="Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?"></a>Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?</h2><p>The short and simple answer is no. In fact, most people are not ASMR sensitive and they don’t experience a tingling sensation when they hear someone whispering or see some of the common visual triggers of ASMR.</p><p>In addition, those who are capable of experiencing AMSR cannot initiate the sensation with just any of the known triggers. In most cases, ASMR is triggered by a particular sound or a visual stimulus that helps the person relax and feel the pleasurable sensation spread through their body.</p><p>Most ASMR videos are long so that the viewer can take their time to unwind before falling asleep.

Don’t force yourself to post on specific days"></a>1. Don’t force yourself to post on specific days</h2><p>I know what you’re thinking - “What?! That’s insane.” The first piece of advice I received about YouTube was to create a schedule of days to post so your viewers look forward to videos. That just doesn’t work for me. Whenever I became too busy with work, I couldn’t stick to my typical Tuesday or Thursday schedule. I think it’s best to focus on how many times you can post in a week rather than a specific day. I try to post at least once a week and that’s my goal. You can always increase as your workload gets lighter or you when you are able to do YouTube full-time.</p><h2 id="2-Keep-track-of-all-your-ideas-in-one-notebook-planner"><a href="#2-Keep-track-of-all-your-ideas-in-one-notebook-planner" class="headerlink" title="2.

When I first started my channel, I had a separate planner just for my YouTube videos – this didn’t work cause I never looked at it. It worked best when I kept track of my entire life, including YouTube, in one planner since I look at it every day. Then I could also see which days I wanted to post a video or see what topics worked best around specific holidays and such.</p><h2 id="3-Check-the-weather-forecast-in-advance"><a href="#3-Check-the-weather-forecast-in-advance" class="headerlink" title="3.

Life happens and it can set you back on filming. If you happen to get a major break in your workweek, use the opportunity to film a bunch of videos, edit them, and have them waiting in your pocket. I filmed three videos in one day – I planned and set-up the night before, which made filming much smoother.

Don’t force yourself to post on specific days"></a>1. Don’t force yourself to post on specific days</h2><p>I know what you’re thinking - “What?! That’s insane.” The first piece of advice I received about YouTube was to create a schedule of days to post so your viewers look forward to videos. That just doesn’t work for me. Whenever I became too busy with work, I couldn’t stick to my typical Tuesday or Thursday schedule. I think it’s best to focus on how many times you can post in a week rather than a specific day. I try to post at least once a week and that’s my goal. You can always increase as your workload gets lighter or you when you are able to do YouTube full-time.</p><h2 id="2-Keep-track-of-all-your-ideas-in-one-notebook-planner-3"><a href="#2-Keep-track-of-all-your-ideas-in-one-notebook-planner-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

When I first started my channel, I had a separate planner just for my YouTube videos – this didn’t work cause I never looked at it. It worked best when I kept track of my entire life, including YouTube, in one planner since I look at it every day. Then I could also see which days I wanted to post a video or see what topics worked best around specific holidays and such.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094422/7443" target="_top" id="2094422">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094422" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094422/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Check-the-weather-forecast-in-advance-3"><a href="#3-Check-the-weather-forecast-in-advance-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Life happens and it can set you back on filming. If you happen to get a major break in your workweek, use the opportunity to film a bunch of videos, edit them, and have them waiting in your pocket. I filmed three videos in one day – I planned and set-up the night before, which made filming much smoother.

You have published your content and it’s not getting the views you had hoped.</p><p>Well, let’s change that!</p><p>In this guide, I’m going to walk you through YouTube SEO from the very start to the very end.</p><p>Nothing complicated. No paid programs or expensive apps needed. We are going back to basics and get your videos discovered.</p><p>Ready?</p><p>Let’s Go!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Research-Your-Topic-and-Competitors"><a href="#Part-1-Research-Your-Topic-and-Competitors" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Research Your Topic and Competitors"></a>Part 1: Research Your Topic and Competitors</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Come up with a video idea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Can’t come up with one? Let me help. I heard you can make a mean scrambled egg, why don’t you show the world how you do it?</p><p>Excellent! Let’s go with that idea.</p><p>Wait, don’t go making the video yet. First, we have to do some research. We need to know what videos already exist out there.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Find-Related-Videos"><a href="#Step-1-Find-Related-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Find Related Videos"></a>Step 1: Find Related Videos</h4><p>Do a quick search on YouTube to see what videos already exist on your topic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-related-videos.jpg"                      alt="Find Related Videos Sample"                ></p><p>Uh oh… your video will be competing against celebrities like Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver.</p><p>Okay, don’t panic! There is a fantastic quote, credited to bestselling author, <a class="link"   href="https://acuff.me/" >Jon Acuff <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that goes:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fantastic-quote-do-not-compare-beginning-to-middle.jpg"                      alt="fantastic quote"                ></p><p>While researching your competition, you will feel overwhelmed, but remember, you are at the beginning, and Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver are not even at their middle, they are way passed the finish line. You still have a long journey to go, so don’t get discouraged, get inspired!</p><p>Watch those videos and understand what they are all about.</p><p>Understand that people watch YouTube for 3 key reasons:</p><p>- To be entertained</p><p>- To learn something new</p><p>- To be inspired</p><p>A video that can hit all 3 marks is going to be positioned for success. Don’t fret too much about the competition, as long as your content is good, you will see improvement.</p><p>So if you think this scrambled egg idea can hit those 3 marks, then I encourage you to go to the next step. If you don’t, let’s regroup and brainstorm some more <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-Keywords"><a href="#Step-2-Find-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find Keywords"></a>Step 2: Find Keywords</h4><p>Now that we’ve decided that we are sticking with the video idea, we are ready to do some keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases people type in the YouTube search bar to discover videos.</p><p>Come up with as many relevant keywords as you can. Start by entering a keyword into the YouTube search bar. This will tell you what are the most popular searches associated with that keyword:</p><p>Once you have an idea of what people are searching for related to your topic, you’ll want to find more relevant keywords. I like to use the free app, <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-seo-tool-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="Find Keywords with Ubersuggest"                ></p><p>This app gives you a whole list of long-tail keywords, which are 3-4-word phrases which is specific to what your video is about.</p><p>Some you will use to dig deeper in and other you will deem irrelevant to your videos. A good way of determining the value of a keyword is by the stats the application shows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-keywords-with-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="Keywords in Ubersuggest"                ></p><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions"><a href="#How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="How to Read Keyword Suggestions"></a>How to Read Keyword Suggestions</h4><p>Once you have a list of keywords, you will see some numbers on the right-hand side. Here is what each one is about:</p><p><strong>- Search volume</strong> is the number used to identify the popularity of the keyword. The higher the number the more people are searching for it.</p><p><strong>- CPC</strong> is the value accredited by YouTube, determining how much advertisers are paying to target audiences who search for that keyword and click on the link.</p><p><strong>- Competition</strong> is the number used to qualify how many other content are using that keyword.</p><p>The two categories that matter most to us right now is Search Volume and Competition. We want keywords with high search volume and low competition rate.</p><p>In the example above, you can see that the keyword “<strong>avocado scrambled eggs</strong>” has a Search Volume of <strong>1,000</strong> and a competition rate of <strong>0.0</strong>. This is a good keyword to target, if you can incorporate an avocado to your dish… which of course you can!</p><h4 id="Step-3-Write-Title"><a href="#Step-3-Write-Title" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Write Title"></a>Step 3: Write Title</h4><p>I know you might want to deal with the Title, Description, and Tags after you’ve filmed and edited your video. But if you want to apply a YouTube SEO-focused strategy, then these should be addressed before you even pick up a camera as it can greatly dictate the content you end up creating.</p><p>A good YouTube title sparks curiosity, evokes emotional reaction, and promises value to your viewers.</p><p>Of course you can title your video simply: <strong>Making Scrambled Eggs</strong></p><p>But does it spark curiosity? Not really… most people can make scrambled eggs.</p><p>Does it evoke any emotion? Maybe hunger… but even then, not really…</p><p>Finally, does it promise value? Well, assuming that most people can at least crack an egg into a pan, then hardly.</p><p>Your scrambled egg is special! Your video is special! We need to evoke that in the title — and as long as you are not writing any clickbait and deliver on what the title suggest, you can do this.</p><p>So, how about this: <strong>Are My Amazing Scrambled Eggs Better Than Gordon Ramsay’s?</strong></p><p>Hmmm… Well, is it? We know that the Gordon Ramsay’s video has almost 30M views. Many people have already tried cooking it, I’m sure. There is only one way to find out, by encouraging others to try it over Gordon’s.</p><p>You don’t need to go for a somewhat contentious title like this, but that’s the idea, you want something that gets people curious, make them feel a certain way, and in the end, make them better for having watched your video.</p><p>See how a good title can guide the rest of your video?</p><h4 id="Step-4-Write-Description"><a href="#Step-4-Write-Description" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Write Description"></a>Step 4: Write Description</h4><p>You aren’t going to be writing the description for the viewers necessarily, you are going to be writing it for YouTube’s algorithms. The better YouTube understands what your video is about, the better they can show it to people searching for it.</p><p>This means you need to include the keywords you were researching at the beginning of your description, as YouTube will be using them to identify the content of your video. 1 or 2 keywords that best represent your video is enough. Don’t stuff the title with too many keywords or you’ll risk sounding like a robot.</p><p>But also use the description for practical uses too, if you have additional information such as supportive links, outline of the video’s content, a list of materials, step-by-step guide, or a recipe that you think your human viewers will find useful, you should input that in the description as well.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Write-Tags"><a href="#Step-5-Write-Tags" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Write Tags"></a>Step 5: Write Tags</h4><p>Thank goodness we did the keyword research in Step 2, because coming up with tags is not as easy as it looks.</p><p>Pull 15 keywords from the list and keep it somewhere safe.</p><p>Note: The keywords you used in the title should be found in your tags, and since they are the most important ones, you should place them first.</p><p>Organize your keywords in the tag as such:</p><p>Have the specific keywords at the top, followed by more general keywords, and then branded ones:</p><p><strong>Specific</strong>: How to make scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>General</strong>: Scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>Branded</strong>: Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible"><a href="#Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible"></a>Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how relevant your keywords are or how epic your title is, if you video sucks (i.e. your viewers click in and leave right away), YouTube will not show it in search.</p><p>Even if you haven’t created any videos yet, you can follow these next steps to ensure you are following the best practices to structure your video.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook"><a href="#Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook"></a>Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook</h4><p>The first few seconds is where the largest percentage of your earned viewership will drop off. Odds are <a class="link"   href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/marketing-online-video-viewers-quit-30-seconds/146218/" >20% of your viewers won’t even get past the first 10 seconds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>What you need is a hook, an intro that ensures this video is what they want to watch and let’s them know what they can expect.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Film-B-Roll"><a href="#Step-7-Film-B-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Film B-Roll"></a>Step 7: Film B-Roll</h4><p>One static camera shot of you talking or cooking or giving a tutorial can cause your viewers to lose attention.</p><p>In order to keep your viewers interest, you will need b-roll, or supplemental footage you can cut to give you video more life.</p><p>While jump cuts (cuts made on a sequential clip of the same subject or in the same camera position) are fine, having additional footage to cut to will make your video feel more fluid.</p><p>So when you are filming your scrambled egg video, make sure you get some footage of you cracking the egg, scrambling it, and serving it on the plate.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video"><a href="#Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"></a>Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video</h4><p>Liking, disliking, subscribing, and commenting on your video will all help your performance indirectly.</p><p>While YouTube wouldn’t rank your video higher simply because you have more likes subscribers, or comments, engagement from viewers help your video get discovered. If you get a like or comment from a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers, your video may be visible to those who are following that YouTuber for a while.</p><p>The best way to get engagement from your audience is to encourage them to like and subscribe or ask them a question or start a dialogue.</p><p>For example, in this scrambled egg video you are making, at the end you can ask, “So what do you think, is this better than Gordon Ramsay?”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/encourage-viewers-to-engage-min.gif"                      alt="Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094477/7443" target="_top" id="2094477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094477/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Who knows, who will respond.</p><h4 id="Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail"><a href="#Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Step 9: Design a Thumbnail"></a>Step 9: Design a Thumbnail</h4><p>You could have made a brilliant video, but if you have a poor quality thumbnail that is unattractive, then the overall performance of your video will suffer — and good SEO can only do so much after that.</p><p>Your viewers will absolutely judge your video by its cover so it’s important to put some thought into it and not solely rely on the three random thumbnail choices that YouTube picks for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/design-youtube-video-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Design a Thumbnail"                ></p><p>Take a look at your competition. If they all look the same, do something different. Add text or a human face (preferably yours) to evoke emotion, as viewers are more likely to click into a video if they see an expressive image.</p><p>Don’t want to pay money for a photo editing software such as Photoshop?</p><p>You can use an online service called <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or download <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an open-source photo editor much like Photoshop, but far less powerful.

By the way, you can also use some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >automatic transcription software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist"><a href="#Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="Step 12: Add Video to Playlist"></a>Step 12: Add Video to Playlist</h4><p>Finally the last thing you need to do for your video is to add it to a playlist. Even though it might be the first video in the playlist, it helps YouTube identify your video if you organize it in a playlist. As you accumulate more content, having videos in playlists makes content easier to find and keeps relevant videos together.</p><p>When viewers searches, having your videos in playlists increases the chance of it being discovered.</p><p>So if your first video is about scrambled eggs, maybe you next video can be about the awesome butter toasts.</p><p>I guess, you are on your way to making a pretty badass breakfast playlist. I personally can’t wait to see it!</p><p>If you treat SEO as an afterthought, only after your video is created, you are not using it to its full potential. If you follow these 12 steps during the course of your production, you will find that SEO doesn’t simply help your video perform at the end, but contributes in all the other phases of creating your video as well.</p><p>Besides considering YouTube SEO, you should make a good YouTube video as well.

Using a chroma key tool, like the <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/">one in <strong>Filmora</strong></a>, you can add animations and transitions into your videos.</p><p>Say, for example, that you want to make a video where you’re hanging out with a CGI alien.

Their effects include overlays, transitions, titles, and animations. Everything is free, but they do request that you link back to them in your video description if you monetize.</p><p>At GREEN SCREEN ANIMATION you will find lots of corporate and tech-industry effects, but they also have playlists of effects for makeup videos, military-themed effects, and animations inspired by movies (among other things).</p><h2 id="BestGreenScreen"><a href="#BestGreenScreen" class="headerlink" title="BestGreenScreen"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bestgreenscreen/featured" >BestGreenScreen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>This channel specializes in action and sci-fi effects.

There are lots of cool overlays included in Filmora, or available through our effects store, and if you go hunting through this and other free green screens&#x2F;chroma key effect channels you can find even more.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> to obtain most of these effects, you will need to use a service that allows you to save&#x2F;download YouTube videos.</p><p>One of the easiest ways to save videos is by using Save From. Just go to the watch page for the video and type ‘ss’ in front of YouTube in the address bar (so your address looks like <strong><a class="link"   href="http://www.ssyoutube/" >http://www.ssyoutube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>).

Ice Cream took one day and 16 hours to get 100 million views on YouTube, making it one of the fastest 100 million views on this video-sharing platform.</p><p>In the music video, Selena, Lisa, Rosé Jisoo, and Jennie are wearing different clothes and sets. Selena is seen in a high-waisted, red-and-white-striped Shoshanna bikini; her next look includes an Eighties-inspired Puma bodysuit. The five girls portray several versions of today’s woman image who know what they are worth and what they want.</p><h4 id="6-Lalisa-by-Lisa-3"><a href="#6-Lalisa-by-Lisa-3" class="headerlink" title="6) Lalisa by Lisa"></a>6) Lalisa by Lisa</h4><p>Lalisa is the debut single by Lisa of Blackpink; it’s the lead single from the musician’s debut album of the same name. The song is a dynamic hip-hop track with influence from Thai culture. The music video garnered 100 million YouTube views in two days and one hour.</p><p>The video is visually-packed with ten set-ups and 13 outfit changes, making it exciting to watch. In the video, the artist appears sitting perched on an ornate throne, and she is adorned in gold jewelry with matching nails. The best part of her outfit is the traditional Thai headdress, which is tiered and anointed with flowers. Lisa ascends to the throne while she’s alternately executing excellent, intricate choreography.</p><h4 id="7-Permission-to-Dance-by-BTS-3"><a href="#7-Permission-to-Dance-by-BTS-3" class="headerlink" title="7) Permission to Dance by BTS"></a>7) Permission to Dance by BTS</h4><p>Permission to Dance was released July 9, 2021, through Sony Music and Big Hit Music as a stand-alone single. It’s the group’s third English-language single. Mac, Andrews, and Stephen Kirk were in charge of the production.</p><p>The music video hit 100 million views in two days and two hours. In the video, the boy band wears cowboy outfits and breaks their dance moves in the Western background. The theme of Permission to Dance looks like the end of the coronavirus pandemic as nations resume their normal activities and declare the worst of this disease seems to be behind them.</p><h4 id="8-Life-Goes-on-by-BTS-3"><a href="#8-Life-Goes-on-by-BTS-3" class="headerlink" title="8) Life Goes on by BTS"></a>8) Life Goes on by BTS</h4><p>Released through Columbia Records and Big Hit Entertainment on November 20, 2020, Life Goes On is the lead single from BTS’ 5th Korean-language studio album Be. It was produced by j-hope, SUGA, Antonia Armato, Chris James, Ruuth, RM, and Pdogg.</p><p>The video reached 100 million views on YouTube in 2 days and 3 hours. And this makes it among the fastest 100 million views on YouTube. The band appears to be lounging lazily, playing a video game. One of the members comes, V, with pizza, and they enjoy it together. V then takes the other members for a drive. When they came back, they watched some movies. They later went to a stadium and performed this song without the audience.</p><h4 id="9-Kill-This-Love-by-Blackpink-3"><a href="#9-Kill-This-Love-by-Blackpink-3" class="headerlink" title="9) Kill This Love by Blackpink"></a>9) Kill This Love by Blackpink</h4><p>Kill This Love was released by YG Entertainment on April 5, 2019, and it was distributed through Interscope Records and YG Plus. It’s the group’s first Korean material since June 2018, when they released Square Up. The song is the lead single and Blackpink’s debut release with Interscope Records. Its official music video amassed 100 million views in 2 days and 14 hours.</p><p>The music video begins with introduction shots of each member of Blackpink; they are in a room surrounded by trumpets. Jennie performs with 2 massive swan set pieces with the sunset behind her. Lisa then struts around a candy shop as she knocks things off shelves and kicks displays. The scene with Jisoo is a stark contrast, as we see the sun against a black setting with her head being above a pool of water. Next, viewers will see a distraught Rosé, as she’s driving a sports car fast chasing down her doppelganger.</p><h4 id="10-Psy-Gentleman-3"><a href="#10-Psy-Gentleman-3" class="headerlink" title="10) Psy Gentleman"></a>10) Psy Gentleman</h4><p>Gentleman, a K-pop song, was released on April 12, 2013. It serves as the follow-up to Psy’s hit single Gangnam Style. Gentleman’s music video took 2 days and 19 hours to get 100 million views on YouTube. Also, it held the record as the fastest YouTube video to 100 million views for more than six years.</p><p>The video features the artist performing different pranks on people; Psy later meets a lady who pulls pranks on him. Psy is wearing a tuxedo and sunglasses as he walks a paved street hill together with a company of relatively older men. He then stops and kicks a traffic cone.</p><h2 id="More-Fun-Facts-about-YouTube-View-Record-3"><a href="#More-Fun-Facts-about-YouTube-View-Record-3" class="headerlink" title="More Fun Facts about YouTube View Record"></a>More Fun Facts about YouTube View Record</h2><h4 id="Fastest-1-Million-Views-on-YouTube-3"><a href="#Fastest-1-Million-Views-on-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Fastest 1 Million Views on YouTube"></a>Fastest 1 Million Views on YouTube</h4><p>Butter by BTS is the video that has garnered the fastest 1 million views on YouTube.

Firstly because it means you have to do all the work of shooting and editing every day and secondly because it means you need to have something to talk about every single day. Even vlogging once or twice a week is tough.</p><p>How do you know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what you should talk about in your vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? Some people are so comfortable in front of the camera they can just turn it on and start talking about whatever’s on their mind, but they’re in the minority.</p><p>Before starting your daily vlogging, you have to figure out one important thing ahead of time.</p><h2 id="Do-you-have-a-niche"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-niche" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a niche?"></a>Do you have a niche?</h2><p>  You should have a niche. In a genre as broad as vlogging it is important to have some kind of hook that sets you apart from other vloggers. This can be an interest that you have, an industry you work in, or even a field of study you’re involved in at school. If you’re into technology, for example, you’ll always have a wealth of subjects to vlog about because all you’ll have to do is look at the day’s tech news and make a video reporting and commenting on it.</p><p>The other reason it’s good to have a niche is that you’ll be able to use keywords related to that niche in your video titles and tags. It’s hard to make it with a vlogging channel because nobody is searching for your content unless you are covering a specific topic like the technology they want to hear about.</p><ul><li><a href="#watching">What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</a></li><li><a href="#snapshots">Snapshots of Your Day</a></li><li><a href="#get-out">Whatever You Need to Get Out</a></li><li><a href="#learn">What did you learn today?</a></li></ul><p>Here are 4 things to talk about in your daily vlog:</p><h2 id="What-are-you-watching-reading"><a href="#What-are-you-watching-reading" class="headerlink" title="What are you watching&#x2F;reading?"></a>What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</h2><p> If you’re really into a book or tv show, or if you saw a movie recently, then those are all good things to talk about (warn people if you’re going to spoil anything!). You do recaps, reviews, or just share a few thoughts you had. If you’re worried about alienating people who don’t watch&#x2F;read the same stuff as you then you can keep it more general and just react to a few things from the media you’re consuming while also talking about your day. It’ll give you an anchor to build the rest of your video around, even if it’s not all you talk about.</p><p>By commenting on what you’re watching&#x2F;reading you have a better chance of capitalizing on a trending topic people are searching for. You could also find yourself an audience by becoming involved in fan communities.</p><h2 id="Snapshots-of-Your-Day"><a href="#Snapshots-of-Your-Day" class="headerlink" title="Snapshots of Your Day"></a>Snapshots of Your Day</h2><p> Casey Neistat is the master of this. He is always ready with a camera on hand so that, when something interesting happens, he can capture it and build his daily vlog around it.</p><p>Carrying a camera around like Casey may or may not suit your lifestyle, but you can still pick out one story from your day to tell. It doesn’t have to be a major event, and you shouldn’t worry that it won’t be interesting to other people. It’s your personality they’re tuning in for, so even if you’re just talking about a funny thing your cat did it will keep your audience interested because a) it’s you talking about it and b) it gives them a bit of insight into your life.</p><h2 id="Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out"><a href="#Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out" class="headerlink" title="Whatever You Need to Get Out"></a>Whatever You Need to Get Out</h2><p><em>Flula is frequently puzzled by English expressions, like ‘Party Pooper’, and needs to get his confusion off his chest at odd hours of the day.</em></p><p> Ranting about people you know can get messy when people from your offline life see it, so maybe avoid that. However, if you’re angry about something in general – or really happy about something – then whatever it is you’re feeling strongly about is probably the thing you should be vlogging about.</p><p>It does not matter what it is that is making you have this strong reaction (unless, again, it’s an actual person who might see your video and cause problems for you). If you’re mad about a real injustice in the world then that’s a great thing to talk about – you might even raise some awareness for the issue – but you can also rant about your favorite flavor of yogurt being cut and that’ll be engaging to viewers too.</p><p>Alternatively: you could do a vlog about how happy you are to have gotten engaged or a vlog about how happy you are that it was sunny today, and your enthusiasm will carry your audience through either video with you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148127/17093" target="_top" id="2148127">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2148127" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148127/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-did-you-learn-today"><a href="#What-did-you-learn-today" class="headerlink" title="What did you learn today?"></a>What did you learn today?</h2><p> <em>Fun fact: The original lyrics Paul McCartney imagined for ‘Yesterday’ were ‘Scrambled eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs’.</em></p><p> You learn something new every day, right? Why not share that factoid with your viewers. Here a few facts to get you started:</p><p> Whales evolved from a land-based animal called a pakicetus.</p><p>The hagfish hunt by swimming into the mouth of a larger fish and eating it from the inside.</p><p>Crows live in family units, visit their aging parents, and have funerals for dead crows.</p><p>The puya chilensis is a plant that ‘eats’ sheep (sheep get stuck to it, starve, and end up as fertilizer).</p><p>Sea monkeys can survive in space.</p><h2 id="EVERYTHING"><a href="#EVERYTHING" class="headerlink" title="EVERYTHING"></a>EVERYTHING</h2><p>You could also just flick the camera on and tell the full story of your day like you’d do in a traditional daily blog. What did you have for breakfast, how was school&#x2F;work, did you talk to any friends, how was the weather – anything and everything. Generally, these videos can run a bit long and don’t have a lot of snappy editing. They’re faster to make, which is good if you’re doing them every day, but the unpolished nature of them won’t appeal to everyone. It will be exactly what appeals to some people, though.</p><h2 id="Customize-Your-Vlog-Stories-with-Powerful-Video-Editor"><a href="#Customize-Your-Vlog-Stories-with-Powerful-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Customize Your Vlog Stories with Powerful Video Editor"></a>Customize Your Vlog Stories with Powerful Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>We’ve got a new eBook out!</strong></p><p>It’s got strategies that have worked for other YouTubers, boiled down to simple action steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>Every genre on YouTube has its own unique challenges, but <strong>daily vlogging</strong> is probably the hardest thing you could take on.

In this post, you will learn every possible fix to the ‘Battlefield 4 no sound’ issue.</p><h2 id="6-Fixes-for-Battlefield-4-No-Sound-Issues"><a href="#6-Fixes-for-Battlefield-4-No-Sound-Issues" class="headerlink" title="6 Fixes for Battlefield 4 No Sound Issues"></a>6 Fixes for Battlefield 4 No Sound Issues</h2><p> We know how frustrating it can be when you can’t hear anything in a game. Below you will find fixes to get your audio work again in Battlefield 4. Before you head to the following fixes, make sure you check the connections of your headset&#x2F;speakers.</p><ol><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Update your audio drivers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Check your default playback device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Check Windows Volume Mixer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Disable Windows Defender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Verify the game integrity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Rule out other interference <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li></ol><h2 id="Fix-1-Update-your-audio-drivers"><a href="#Fix-1-Update-your-audio-drivers" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1. Update your audio drivers"></a>Fix 1. Update your audio drivers</h2><p> A faulty&#x2F;outdated audio driver can cause game audio issues. An audio driver is a translator for your system and device, and if it goes wrong, you will be having sound problems. There are onboard sound card drivers and headset drivers (for some older ones).</p><p> To ensure that you have the latest &amp; correct audio driver installed, you can go to<strong>Device Manager</strong> and update all your audio drivers there.

A loop is a popular element in photography and especially music videos, the idea being that the camera appears to magically repeat itself as many times as there are photos or frames showing the action. They can also simply recur a sequence a certain number of times, then stop.</p><p>Now some people don’t know how to make looping videos, so in this article, we are going to discuss <strong>how to loop a video on iPhone videos</strong> and also how to loop YouTube videos on iPhone.

Loop videos can be created with features on social media apps and third-party apps.</p><p>iPhone has a setting that allows you to edit the photos to loop or bounce videos, and it only works with a photo feature called ‘live photo’. The live photo feature records 1.5 seconds moving picture when you click on the shutter button.</p><p>The live photo feature can be edited to create a loop video, and you can do that by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Before creating the video, you need to have the live picture saved on your phone.</li></ol><p>To do this, capture a live photo by opening your camera app. Then click on the live photo icon, which is located in the upper right corner.

After all, it lets us narrate our story via two (or more) screens and gives our audience a superior viewing experience. Though, a lot of users find it hard to implement the split-screen effect on YouTube videos. Here, I will let you know how to come up with all kinds of YouTube split-screen videos by using a professional video editor.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Diverse-Applications-of-Split-screen-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-The-Diverse-Applications-of-Split-screen-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Diverse Applications of Split-screen Videos"></a>Part 1: The Diverse Applications of Split-screen Videos</h2><p>Before we discuss how to work on YouTube split-screen videos, let’s quickly consider some major applications of this video effect.</p><ul><li><h3 id="To-draw-a-direct-comparison"><a href="#To-draw-a-direct-comparison" class="headerlink" title="To draw a direct comparison"></a>To draw a direct comparison</h3></li></ul><p>One of the most popular applications of split-screen videos is for comparing two or more instances or perspectives in the same frame. For example, you might wish to depict the lifestyle of two people from different parts of the world or simply compare the effect of various seasons in a single video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-1.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><ul><li><h3 id="To-provide-two-or-more-perspectives"><a href="#To-provide-two-or-more-perspectives" class="headerlink" title="To provide two or more perspectives"></a>To provide two or more perspectives</h3></li></ul><p>Videos are the best visual storytelling tools and just like any story, they can also have different perspectives. Ideally, the split-screen effect would be one of the best ways to show your audience all kinds of perspectives that can take place in your story.</p><p>One of the best examples was depicted in the movie “500 Days of Summer” in which we got several Expectations vs. Reality shots. These split-screen shots depicted the two major perspectives of the story in a single frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-2.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><ul><li><h3 id="To-implement-the-cloning-effect"><a href="#To-implement-the-cloning-effect" class="headerlink" title="To implement the cloning effect"></a>To implement the cloning effect</h3></li></ul><p>Have you ever wondered how filmmakers create a clone of a person in movies? To do that, we make the protagonist record both the scenes in front of the same background. Later, we implement a split-screen effect in which both the clips are combined in such a way that it makes the audience believe as if the scene has both, the character and their clone placed flawlessly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-3.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><h3 id="Watch-Video-Use-Split-Screen-for-Your-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Watch-Video-Use-Split-Screen-for-Your-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Watch Video!

For example, you might wish to depict the lifestyle of two people from different parts of the world or simply compare the effect of various seasons in a single video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-1.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><ul><li><h3 id="To-provide-two-or-more-perspectives-1"><a href="#To-provide-two-or-more-perspectives-1" class="headerlink" title="To provide two or more perspectives"></a>To provide two or more perspectives</h3></li></ul><p>Videos are the best visual storytelling tools and just like any story, they can also have different perspectives. Ideally, the split-screen effect would be one of the best ways to show your audience all kinds of perspectives that can take place in your story.</p><p>One of the best examples was depicted in the movie “500 Days of Summer” in which we got several Expectations vs. Reality shots. These split-screen shots depicted the two major perspectives of the story in a single frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-2.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><ul><li><h3 id="To-implement-the-cloning-effect-1"><a href="#To-implement-the-cloning-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="To implement the cloning effect"></a>To implement the cloning effect</h3></li></ul><p>Have you ever wondered how filmmakers create a clone of a person in movies? To do that, we make the protagonist record both the scenes in front of the same background. Later, we implement a split-screen effect in which both the clips are combined in such a way that it makes the audience believe as if the scene has both, the character and their clone placed flawlessly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-3.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148619/17108" target="_top" id="2148619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2148619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="100" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148619/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Watch-Video-Use-Split-Screen-for-Your-YouTube-Videos-1"><a href="#Watch-Video-Use-Split-Screen-for-Your-YouTube-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Watch Video!
