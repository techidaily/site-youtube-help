Viewers find poor lighting distracting and it’s hard for them to see how great your content is if they are busy thinking about why your video is so dark. By creating a great lighting set up you can ensure that the people watching your videos are only thinking about how much they’re enjoying them.</p><p>Going outside and using natural light is the cheapest way to get a lot of light for your videos. If your vlog is not suited to the great outdoors then you need to get more strategic. You can turn on all the lights in your living room and still end up with a dark, grainy, video.</p><h2 id="Video-Lighting-Basics-Three-Point-Lighting"><a href="#Video-Lighting-Basics-Three-Point-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Video Lighting Basics: Three Point Lighting"></a>Video Lighting Basics: Three Point Lighting</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-point-lighting.jpg"                      alt="Lighting for YouTube Video"                ></p><p>The most common technique of lighting a scene is called <strong>three-point lighting</strong>. It involves three different sources of light in the shot and is used by portrait photographers, which is also a great method for lighting your vlog.</p><p>The brightest source of light is also known as the <strong>key light</strong> which need to be high quality. A window will work, but if you do not have access to one where you are filming then consider an LED panel light or a softbox light like the ones used in portrait photography.</p><p>This first light will create a dramatic shadow across half of your face. You want to reduce this shadow, but not get rid of it completely.</p><p>Rather than setting up another light source on the opposite side of the camera, put up a reflector to bounce some light back onto your face. This reflector is called your <strong>‘Fill Light’</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>fill light</strong> is less bright than the primary source of light and it is placed on the side opposite to the key light. Its purpose is to reduce shadows produced by the key light and the reflector will need to be mounted on a stand.</p><p>The final step to creating three point lighting is to set up another light behind you. This is your ‘Backlight’, and it will help you stand out from your background. <strong>Backlight or Hair light</strong> is always placed behind and above the subject to create separation between the subject in the shot and the background. This basic lighting technique can be applied in almost every scene you shoot, which is why it is important to keep an open mind and to continue experimenting with possible light setups.</p><h3 id="Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging"><a href="#Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging" class="headerlink" title="Watch Video! Top Lighting Tips for Vlogging"></a>Watch Video! Top Lighting Tips for Vlogging</h3><h2 id="Lightning-Tips-for-Aspiring-YouTube-Videographers"><a href="#Lightning-Tips-for-Aspiring-YouTube-Videographers" class="headerlink" title="Lightning Tips for Aspiring YouTube Videographers"></a>Lightning Tips for Aspiring YouTube Videographers</h2><p>Becoming the master of light will take some time and practice, so it is crucial to remain curious and anxious to learn new tricks throughout that process if you want to continually become better. These tips will help you make the first steps on that journey.</p><h4 id="1-Focus-Your-Key-Light"><a href="#1-Focus-Your-Key-Light" class="headerlink" title="1.  Focus Your Key Light"></a>1.  Focus Your Key Light</h4><p>Try to focus your Key Light so that it lights only you and not your background. Do this by mounting anything that can cast a shadow onto your Key Light to control the area where the light hits. If you are using a window for your Key Light then you can use a curtain. If you use a softbox light then your light will already be somewhat focused.</p><h4 id="2-Use-Natural-Lighting"><a href="#2-Use-Natural-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Natural Lighting"></a>2. Use Natural Lighting</h4><p>The light provided by the Sun is still the best light source, you can have in your video. The trouble is that natural light changes quickly, which makes it highly unpredictable. The best way to deal with this challenge is to come prepared to the set and to get the shot you want as quickly as you can.</p><h4 id="3-Try-DIY-Lightning"><a href="#3-Try-DIY-Lightning" class="headerlink" title="3.  Try DIY Lightning"></a>3.  Try DIY Lightning</h4><p>Literally, anything from candles to LED light bulbs can serve as a source of light in a shot. You just need to pay attention to the light temperature, because warmer light sources may highlight reds and yellows that can make your footage look less realistic.</p><h4 id="4-Use-Lightning-Kits"><a href="#4-Use-Lightning-Kits" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Lightning Kits"></a>4. Use Lightning Kits</h4><p>This is by far the best option if you want to be in complete control of the light on your set. You can adjust the intensity of the lights, use filters, diffusers and all sorts of other accessories to create the light that flatters the subjects of your videos. The only downside is that you’ll have to spend a considerable amount of money if you want to have a professional lighting kit.</p><h4 id="5-Set-up-reflectors"><a href="#5-Set-up-reflectors" class="headerlink" title="5.  Set up reflectors"></a>5.  Set up reflectors</h4><p>Sets of reflectors are often under $50, so they are fairly affordable. However, some vloggers choose to forgo purchasing reflectors and make their own out of tinfoil.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lighting-tips01.JPG"                      alt="lighting tips"                ></p><p>If your strong main light is too hard on your eyes then you can use a translucent ‘reflector’ to soften it. Set your translucent reflector, or other screen, up in front of your main light to diffuse it.</p><p>If you are hosting a <strong>beauty vlog</strong> then you might consider a slightly different set up. Instead of having your main light off to one side set it up directly in front of you so your entire face is lit evenly. It is still a good idea to use fill lights in this set up to give you some dimension, and a backlight is even more essential for helping you stand out from the background.

Letting more light into your camera can help your footage look brighter, although you also run the risk of making things look overexposed&#x2F; washed out if you are not careful.</p><p>If you are stuck shooting in <strong>low light conditions</strong> it is best to use a lens with a wider aperture&#x2F;lower f-stop.

Since YouTube is a visual media platform, viewers set their eyes on the thumbnails first before they read the title of the video. If you’ve made a collage of YouTube thumbnails or designed YouTube channel art containing various freeze-frame images from different YouTube videos, you are no stranger to needing a fast way to collect YouTube thumbnail images. Online, there are several tools dedicated to solving this exact problem. These are the top five YouTube Thumbnail grabbers:</p><p>These thumbnails can be then be used in videos, blogs, articles, web pages, etc. Let’s have a look at 8 best thumbnail grabbers in the market:</p><ol><li><a href="#youtubegrabber1">YouTube Thumbnail Grabber</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber2">BoingBoing</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber3">Thumbnailsave.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber4">Get YouTube Thumbnail</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber5">Fbutube.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber6">YT Thumbnail Downloader</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber7">Youtubethumbnailimage.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber8">Youthumbnail.com</a></li></ol><h2 id="1-YouTube-Thumbnail-Grabber"><a href="#1-YouTube-Thumbnail-Grabber" class="headerlink" title="#1: YouTube Thumbnail Grabber"></a>#1: YouTube Thumbnail Grabber</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-grabber.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail Grabber"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com/" >https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>YouTube Thumbnail Grabber is at the top of our list. The website is very simple and clean with no ads. All you need to do is enter the YouTube video URL and click on the “Download Images” button. The site will then present you with your downloadable images in different sizes. It’s free and fast!</p><h2 id="2-BoingBoing"><a href="#2-BoingBoing" class="headerlink" title="#2: BoingBoing"></a>#2: BoingBoing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boing-boing.jpg"                      alt="Boing Boing"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://boingboing.net/features/getthumbs.html" >https://boingboing.net/features/getthumbs.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>BoingBoing is faster than YouTube Thumbnail grabber because it skips the “Download Images” step. As soon as you enter in your YouTube video URL, BoingBoing will automatically present you with your downloadable images. Although it is one step faster than YouTube Thumbnail Grabber, you will have to deal with having to view one small ad at the bottom of the page. In case you also want to download freeze frames that occur midway through the video, BoingBoing also gives you the option to download those images as well.</p><h2 id="3-Thumbnailsave-com"><a href="#3-Thumbnailsave-com" class="headerlink" title="#3: Thumbnailsave.com"></a>#3: Thumbnailsave.com</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/thumbnail-save.jpg"                      alt="Thumbnail Save"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://thumbnailsave.com/" >http://thumbnailsave.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Another free, straightforward website for grabbing your YouTube thumbnails is Thumbnailsave.com. Again, all you need to do is enter the YouTube video URL and click the “Submit” button. Unlike our first two options, this site has a lot more ads. You’ll see a banner ad at the top as well as an ad to the side of the page. One interesting thing about this website is that it displays a column of thumbnails recently grabbed by users all over the world (displayed on the right side of the page). You might find this entertaining. If you are captivated by one of the thumbnail images, you can download it onto your computer and then do a reverse image search on Google to find the video.</p><h2 id="4-Get-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#4-Get-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="#4: Get YouTube Thumbnail"></a>#4: Get YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-youtube-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Get YouTube Thumbnail"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.get-youtube-thumbnail.com/" >http://www.get-youtube-thumbnail.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Get YouTube Thumbnail is another free, straightforward tool for grabbing YouTube thumbnail images. All you need to do is paste the URL of the YouTube video and click on the “Get YouTube Thumbnail” button to retrieve your thumbnail. Yes, that’s right. One thumbnail image. What’s different about this website is that it provides you with a unique image URL. This might be useful for anyone not wanting to deal with files. While this website is free to use, it does have ads.</p><h2 id="5-Fbutube-com"><a href="#5-Fbutube-com" class="headerlink" title="#5: Fbutube.com"></a>#5: Fbutube.com</h2><p>Fbtube.com is a tool that is used to download YouTube thumbnails by bloggers, YouTubers, graphic designers, etc. This tool helps to grab all the thumbnails available for a YouTube video.

Instagram jumped on the short-form standing video bandwagon with its Reels and Stories features, and Facebook cloned the same format as Facebook Stories.</p><p>Thus, the trend of vertical video exploded during the pandemic.</p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is an infant feature that allows creators to upload short-form vertical videos to the platform, adding various TikTok-like enhancements, from colorful text to images to different music additions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shortsu-fund.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts F</strong> <strong>und</strong> is identical related to YouTube Shorts. This is quite an interesting concept to study as it’s associated with the vast platform.</p><p>The best part of YouTube Shorts? YouTube has signaled their attention to help creators monetize Shorts and transform them into a solid news revenue stream. To that concern, the company has decided to pay creators at least <strong>$100 million</strong> for their YouTube Shorts monetization through 2022.</p><p>Here we are going to introduce you how to make money on YouTube Shorts and some monetization tips. Just watch the below video.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: What’s YouTube Shorts Fund?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: How to Join&#x2F;Apply for YouTube Shorts Fund?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: How to Claim Bonus Payment from YouTube Shorts Fund?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part 4: FAQs about YouTube Shorts Fund</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-YouTube-Shorts-Fund"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-YouTube-Shorts-Fund" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s YouTube Shorts Fund?"></a>Part 1: What’s YouTube Shorts Fund?</h2><p>The <strong>YouTube Shorts Fund</strong> is a part of the YouTube Shorts monetization scheme. It’s a $100M fund distributed throughout 2021 - 2022.</p><p>As per YouTube’s official website source, anyone can participate in the fund simply by creating unique and engaging Shorts that delight the community of YouTube to a great extent.</p><p>Each month, YouTube reaches multiples of creators whose Shorts received the most views and engagement to reward them for their contributions. YouTube also asks the creators to share their feedback to continue enhancing the overall product experience. So, this activity relates to the YouTube Shorts Fund eligibility.</p><p>However, this YouTube Shorts Fund is generally not limited to just the YouTube Partner Program creators. Such creators will be eligible to participate if they adhere to all the Community Guidelines and create only original content for Shorts.</p><p>Moreover, YouTube kept sharing additional details as they got closer to the same concept.</p><h3 id="The-Future-of-Monetization-on-Shorts"><a href="#The-Future-of-Monetization-on-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="The Future of Monetization on Shorts"></a>The Future of Monetization on Shorts</h3><p>As discussed earlier, the YouTube Shorts Fund is the first step in their journey to build YouTube Shorts, a monetization model.</p><p>Even YouTube is excited to begin rewarding creators for their contributions via the YouTube Shorts Fund. On the same note, they’ll expand their Shorts player across various YouTube surfaces to assist people in looking for new artists, creators, and Shorts to enjoy.</p><p>All in all, YouTube has helped an entire generation of artists and creators turn their creativity into businesses with the YouTube Shorts Fund. YouTube has paid $30 billion-plus money to artists, creators, artists, and media companies over the last three years. They remain deeply committed to supporting the next generation of mobile creators while introducing the YouTube Shorts Fund.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Join-Apply-for-YouTube-Shorts-Fund"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Join-Apply-for-YouTube-Shorts-Fund" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Join&#x2F;Apply for YouTube Shorts Fund?"></a>Part 2: How to Join&#x2F;Apply for YouTube Shorts Fund?</h2><p>First, know that every creator on the platform is eligible to know the YouTube Shorts fund eligibility.</p><p>Your channel has to comply with a strict set of eligibility requirements to activate the YouTube Shorts monetization.</p><p>Your channel has to have multiples of subscribers and four thousand hours of watch time to join the YouTube Partner Program. However, the case is quite different when it comes to YouTube Shorts eligibility.</p><p>The YouTube Shorts Fund only has a single requirement of eligibility criteria to know how to join the YouTube Shorts fund. You have to create original yet lovely content for the viewers.</p><p>You don’t have to be the YouTube Partner Program’s part, nor does your channel have to meet its requirements for monetization. The Shorts Fund is open to each creator.</p><p><strong>YouTube will directly reach out to creators about the fund.</strong></p><p>So far, there’s not a direct way of application for the YouTube Shorts Fund. Creators can’t request an invitation or enroll themselves in the fund. The only way you can join the fund is via a direct YouTube invitation.</p><p>YouTube will divide this fund from the Shorts Fund on a rolling basis. The creators who’ve received the highest amounts of views and engagement levels on their YouTube Shorts will receive the rewards. They plan to reach out to multiples of creators each month.</p><p><strong>It will help if you keep creating great content to prepare for the YouTube Shorts fund.</strong></p><p>The best way you can create is to keep uploading excellent content. You can use this time to become a pro at creating compelling YouTube Shorts among the broader audience base. It would help to grow your audience with Shorts so that your YouTube channel will be present on YouTube’s radar.</p><p>The YouTube Shorts Fund is an ideal opportunity for creators of all sizes to activate YouTube Shorts monetization.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Claim-Bonus-Payment-from-YouTube-Shorts-Fund"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Claim-Bonus-Payment-from-YouTube-Shorts-Fund" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Claim Bonus Payment from YouTube Shorts Fund?"></a>Part 3: How to Claim Bonus Payment from YouTube Shorts Fund?</h2><p>To know how to claim YouTube Shorts Fund or bonus, you’re required to go through the following two steps:</p><ul><li>Accept the terms</li><li>Link an active AdSense account</li></ul><p>Creators who do not have an AdSense account will be able to set one up directly on YouTube as part of the procedure of claiming. Once you claim your YouTube Shorts fund or bonus payment successfully, that amount will get added to your monthly cost of AdSense.</p><p>It is worth defining that channels creating and publishing non-original content, videos re-uploaded from other channels, and videos with the logos or watermarks from third-party social platforms will not be eligible to claim a bonus payment from the YouTube Shorts Fund.</p><p>In addition to the YouTube Shorts Fund, YouTube provides numerous other methods in which creators can earn more revenues from their YouTube content and build their businesses on the platform. These consist of merchandise, ads, YouTube BrandConnect, and channel memberships, among others.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-about-YouTube-Shorts-Fund"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-about-YouTube-Shorts-Fund" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs about YouTube Shorts Fund"></a>Part 4: FAQs about YouTube Shorts Fund</h2><p>Here are some common questions about YouTube Shorts Fund for your reference.</p><h4 id="1-How-do-YouTube-Shorts-go-viral"><a href="#1-How-do-YouTube-Shorts-go-viral" class="headerlink" title="1. How do YouTube Shorts go viral?"></a>1. How do YouTube Shorts go viral?</h4><p>If we want to go viral at YouTube Shorts quickly, you have to follow the procedure consistently. Digital marketing is not rocket science. For someone, it takes one day to go viral, and for another one, to go viral, it takes one year as well. You only have to remember to create excellent, unique content quite consistently.</p><h4 id="2-How-long-can-YouTube-Shorts-be"><a href="#2-How-long-can-YouTube-Shorts-be" class="headerlink" title="2. How long can YouTube Shorts be?"></a>2. How long can YouTube Shorts be?</h4><p>The creation tool of YouTube’s Shorts makes it easy to create short-form videos around 60 seconds long with their multi-segment camera.</p><h4 id="3-Can-YouTube-Shorts-be-copyrighted"><a href="#3-Can-YouTube-Shorts-be-copyrighted" class="headerlink" title="3. Can YouTube Shorts be copyrighted?"></a>3. Can YouTube Shorts be copyrighted?</h4><p>Yes, it can be! However, you can add anything from YouTube’s audio to any copyright-free music to your YouTube Shorts video content.</p><h4 id="4-Why-are-my-YouTube-Shorts-not-getting-views"><a href="#4-Why-are-my-YouTube-Shorts-not-getting-views" class="headerlink" title="4. Why are my YouTube Shorts not getting views?"></a>4. Why are my YouTube Shorts not getting views?</h4><p>Reconsider your approach if you’re not getting any YouTube Shorts views.</p><p>A common reason behind this is that you do not hold the viewer’s attention. The shorter the content, the more each second counts. Or, maybe your subscribers wish for long-form content.</p><h4 id="5-Can-you-upload-a-video-to-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#5-Can-you-upload-a-video-to-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="5. Can you upload a video to YouTube Shorts?"></a>5. Can you upload a video to YouTube Shorts?</h4><p>Videos up to 60 seconds will show a trim editor. For videos longer than 60 seconds, you need to hit the <strong>Edit</strong> button into a Short video size to trim your video up to 60 seconds or less.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you have already created a short-form vertical video or have a YouTube channel, try Shorts out. It could be an excellent manner to activate YouTube Shorts fund monetization or build an income stream for your channel and a new subscriber base.</p><p>If you’ve never used YouTube before, that’s an even great reason to give YouTube Shorts a try. Diving into YouTube can sometimes be challenging — with a potentially broad reach and day-one monetization, YouTube provides unheard-of perks to the creators of new Shorts.</p><p>Most people probably wouldn’t get attracted if any other company launched a new short-form vertical video platform. But because Shorts comes from a platform like YouTube — which has a long history of a massive audience, creator-friendly scenarios, and the power of Google backing it up — the new platform is a must-try for any video creator and creative individual. And, the addition of $100 million YouTube Shorts fund in financial support is a lot of delicious icing on the cake.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-revenue-rising-the-essential-guide-for-youtubers/"><u>2024 Approved  Revenue Rising  The Essential Guide for YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-asmr-youtube-channels/"><u>In 2024, The Best ASMR YouTube Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-video-transfer-youtube-to-dailymotion-conversion/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Video Transfer  YouTube to Dailymotion Conversion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/key-youtube-channels-tracking-trends-for-2024/"><u>Key YouTube Channels Tracking Trends for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-into-song-savvy-youtube-playlist-excellence/"><u>In 2024, Step Into Song Savvy  YouTube Playlist Excellence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-proven-strategies-to-record-clear-audio-without-a-mic/"><u>[New] Proven Strategies to Record Clear Audio Without a Mic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-resizing-youtube-images-step-by-step-guide/"><u>In 2024, Resizing YouTube Images  Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-unveiling-the-art-of-4k-video-submission-to-youtube/"><u>In 2024, Unveiling the Art of 4K Video Submission to YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-economics-of-evaluating-everything-on-electronic-streams/"><u>In 2024, The Economics of Evaluating Everything on Electronic Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/unlock-your-iphone-12-mini-in-minutes-with-iccid-code-everything-you-need-to-know-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Unlock Your iPhone 12 mini in Minutes with ICCID Code Everything You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-asmr-can-boost-your-health-and-happiness/"><u>In 2024, How ASMR Can Boost Your Health & Happiness</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-simplify-your-workflow-incorporating-luts-into-pscc-projects/"><u>[Updated] Simplify Your Workflow  Incorporating LUTs Into PSCC Projects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-unintended-tiktok-reset-how-to-get-back-old-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unintended TikTok Reset – How to Get Back Old Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/techniques-to-combat-unsteady-shot-dynamics/"><u>Techniques to Combat Unsteady Shot Dynamics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/insta-stats-spotlight-pinpointing-viewers-of-your-photos-for-2024/"><u>Insta Stats Spotlight  Pinpointing Viewers of Your Photos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/is-gsm-flasher-adb-legit-full-review-to-bypass-your-tecno-camon-20-premier-5gfrp-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Is GSM Flasher ADB Legit?

You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.</p><p>But what if you’ve created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we’ve put together an extensive guide on <strong>how to</strong> <strong>share a YouTube playlist</strong> on your computer and mobile devices.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><h2 id="Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work"><a href="#Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work" class="headerlink" title="Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?"></a>Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s figure out why the “Share” function doesn’t work. The “Share” function in the playlist does not work because it is set to “private,” and YouTube doesn’t allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, the <strong>YouTube view monetization programs are</strong> not that clear. Most people don’t even know how YouTube monetization views work. How many views on YouTube do you need to start making money from your content on the platform? Some people have even been made to believe the common misconception that views alone determine the amount of money a YouTuber earns. Let’s have a look at what entails views for YouTube monetization and the factors that affect your earnings on the platform.</p><p><strong>YouTube Channel Grower</strong> A cross-platform for enhancing and editing YouTube videos for more engagement!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money"></a><strong>Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money</strong></h2><p>Despite a lot of people seeking a successful career on YouTube, only a handful make it big on the platform. Some of the big names like Mr. Beast have proven how lucrative YouTube can be with the right following. However, for newcomers or beginners, succeeding on YouTube is a challenging feat.</p><p>The most burning question is how many monetized views on YouTube do you need to make money? A great deal of creators are still aiming to monetize YouTube views. Let’s have a look at what YouTube monetization review time involves and the views that get paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-1.JPG"                      alt="how many views to earn on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization"><a href="#Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization"></a><strong>Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization</strong></h3><p>Ideally, you will start earning ad revenue on YouTube for every 100 views on your videos. This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View"></a><strong>Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View</strong></h2><p>The amount of money that YouTubers make may seem complex to understand. Does YouTube pay per view? Yes, but not per video view. YouTube will pay you for views that appear on your channels. The actual revenue will depend on several factors.</p><ul><li><a href="#factor1">Factors Affecting Earnings per View</a></li><li><a href="#factor2">YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</a></li><li><a href="#factor3">Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</a></li><li><a href="#factor4">Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</a></li></ul><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting Earnings per View"></a><strong>Factors Affecting Earnings per View</strong></h3><p>The amount of money YouTubers make per view is affected by various factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Ad Revenue Rates</strong>: The rates vary depending on the country where viewers are located, the time of the year, and the ad your YouTube channel is running.</li><li><strong>Audience Demographics</strong>: Advertisers usually pay more to show their ads to viewers in some demographics, especially those who are interested in specific products or have a high income.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement</strong>: Videos with high CTR and AVD earn more income from ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time</strong>: YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time earn more money.</li></ul><h3 id="YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model"><a href="#YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model" class="headerlink" title="YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model"></a><strong>YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</strong></h3><p>The YouTibe’s revenue-sharing model determines how much creators are paid. The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers.

In terms of internet it is basically based on the permission of using, copying or distributing content that is available online. YouTube is a video sharing website with its own set of rules and regulations in accordance with its license policy.</p><p>When a user is uploading a video he has option license options that he can choose from. The first option is “standard YouTube License” which means that you grant the broadcasting rights to YouTube. This essentially means that your video can only be accessed from YouTube for watching purpose and cannot be reproduced or distributed in any other form without your consent. The second type of license is the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >“Creative Commons” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>In the below video you’ll learn how to set standard YouTube license and cc license:</p><h2 id="What-is-the-difference-between-“Standard-YouTube-License”-and-“Creative-Commons”"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-“Standard-YouTube-License”-and-“Creative-Commons”" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between “Standard YouTube License” and “Creative Commons”"></a>What is the difference between “Standard YouTube License” and “Creative Commons”</h2><p>The basic different is that, with a standard license no one can use your video to reproduce as his own work (without clearly marking the video of the original video). However in a standard licence the original video uploader has some right to say “no” to the re-use of his video because the meaning of the video changes altogether.</p><p>However, if you select the creative commons license while uploading then the author may use any portions of work of the original author. It is generally permitted to edit, recompile, change or alter the original work except few listed things. These include copyrights of original work and a clear mentioning that the work has been derived from an original source. Moreover, that the original author will not be held responsible for any damages caused by the derivative work. This is how the two licenses differ from each other.</p><h2 id="3-Common-questions-for-“YouTube-standard-license”"><a href="#3-Common-questions-for-“YouTube-standard-license”" class="headerlink" title="3 Common questions for “YouTube standard license”?"></a>3 Common questions for “YouTube standard license”?</h2><ul><li><strong>Is it illegal for me to share Standard YouTube license video with my friends on Facebook?</strong></li></ul><p>It is perfectly alright to share YouTube licensed videos on Facebook or any social media because firstly if sharing was prohibited then probably there wouldn’t have been a share button plug in. Moreover, by clicking share or copy-pasting the URL you are just pointing to the video bearing its original author’s name and URL. Hence, it’s not illegal in any way.</p><ul><li><strong>Can media companies (such as TV show) feature my video without my permission?</strong></li></ul><p>Media companies are generally richly profitable organizations. Hence before using content they need to seek legal permission from the original author of the video. This is especially the case when the owner of the video has used the standard license. It is then mandatory for the media house to take permission from the original video owner who had uploaded the video in the first place.</p><ul><li><strong>Can I use the videos marked as “YouTube standard license” for a non-profit video?</strong></li></ul><p>For a YouTube standard licensed video there is hard and fast legal rule. The original author may claim his work as he has been given certain rights to do so. For a non-profit video yet again you might need to convince him on the fact that you haven’t been gaining anything from usage of his content. So it’s still recommendable to seek permission initially.</p><p>You’ll learn “how to legally use copyrighted music, games, and movies on YouTube” from below video:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-scripting-journalisms-closing-statements/"><u>[New] Scripting Journalism's Closing Statements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-revolutionize-video-creation-make-edit-and-share-on-the-go/"><u>2024 Approved  Revolutionize Video Creation  Make, Edit & Share on the Go</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-guiding-you-through-youtubes-security-settings/"><u>2024 Approved  Guiding You Through YouTube's Security Settings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-essential-guide-to-a-bespoke-youtube-channel-url/"><u>In 2024, The Essential Guide to a Bespoke YouTube Channel URL</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tips-for-seamlessly-adding-youtube-to-your-gslides-deck/"><u>2024 Approved  Tips for Seamlessly Adding YouTube to Your GSlides Deck</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-iciness-to-comfort-five-warm-backdrops-ideas/"><u>In 2024, From Iciness to Comfort  Five Warm Backdrops Ideas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tips-for-stellar-video-conclusions/"><u>2024 Approved  Tips for Stellar Video Conclusions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-scaling-up-a-creators-guide-to-major-content-partnerships/"><u>2024 Approved  Scaling Up  A Creator's Guide to Major Content Partnerships</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-spy-on-text-messages-from-computer-and-realme-note-50-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Spy on Text Messages from Computer & Realme Note 50 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-steady-hand-how-to-remove-camera-shake-in-after-effects/"><u>New 2024 Approved The Steady Hand How to Remove Camera Shake in After Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-forgotten-pin-of-your-infinix-hot-40-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Remove Forgotten PIN Of Your Infinix Hot 40</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/mastering-vocal-transformations-high-ranked-app-options-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Vocal Transformations  High-Ranked App Options for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-a-google-pixel-8-pro-easily-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Unlock a Google Pixel 8 Pro Easily?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/8-best-apps-for-screen-mirroring-poco-c65-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>8 Best Apps for Screen Mirroring Poco C65 PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-top-10-essential-videogame-auditory-enhancements-for-the-new-decade/"><u>New Top 10 Essential Videogame Auditory Enhancements for the New Decade</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

If you don’t, potential viewers will miss out on the chance to discover and enjoy your videos.</p><p>Instead of forcing yourself through a painful brainstorming session, it can be easier to identify the best tags using these techniques that experienced content managers use to populate their tag lists.</p><p>In this article, I will show you how to find great tags for your YouTube videos as well as some answers to the frequently asked questions about YouTube Tags.</p><ol><li><a href="#auto">Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool</a></li><li><a href="#gen">Try YouTube Tag Generators</a></li><li><a href="#rival">Study Your YouTube Rivals’ Tags</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Find-YouTube-Tags-3-Effective-Ways"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Find-YouTube-Tags-3-Effective-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Find YouTube Tags [3 Effective Ways]"></a>Part 1: How to Find YouTube Tags [3 Effective Ways]</h2><h3 id="1-Use-YouTube’s-Auto-Suggest-Tool-to-Get-Tags"><a href="#1-Use-YouTube’s-Auto-Suggest-Tool-to-Get-Tags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool to Get Tags"></a>1. Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool to Get Tags</h3><p>YouTube’s search engine can be your best ally on the quest for great tags. This tool was created to aid users who are looking for content on the platform, and content creators can benefit from it as well. By typing the general topic of your video, or a few words vaguely related to your video, into the search bar on YouTube you can see suggestions that reflect what viewers are searching for and take some of those suggestions into consideration for your tags. With every new phrase (and even every additional character you type), new options will appear. By playing around with this tool you will gain valuable insight into the searching habits of YouTube viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-tag-by-searching.jpg"                      alt="Find YouTube Video Tag"                ></p><p>This method may not be too precise, but the idea is to quickly gather information and perhaps get some inspiration for more creative or complex tags. Most of the suggestions will be logical, but there can be a few unexpected combinations you’d never think of. Be very careful when translating the findings to your own situation, since the fact that some terms are popular doesn’t mean they are relevant for your video. Another problem is that slightly altered terminology can significantly change the effectiveness of the tag, so you should ideally use the suggested phrases in the exact form as you found them or not at all. If you do make adjustments, you should test the new tag through the same auto-complete tool and see how it fares.</p><h3 id="2-Try-YouTube-Tag-Generators"><a href="#2-Try-YouTube-Tag-Generators" class="headerlink" title="2.  Try YouTube Tag Generators"></a>2.  Try YouTube Tag Generators</h3><p>If you’d like to dig a little deeper, there are multiple dedicated tools that can assist you in picking the most suitable YouTube tags for every video you upload. Let’s examine a few of them in greater detail:</p><h4 id="1-Keyword-Tool"><a href="#1-Keyword-Tool" class="headerlink" title="#1. Keyword Tool"></a>#1. Keyword Tool</h4><p>A very simple and reliable web-based tag generator that provides you with 750 frequently searched keywords that would be suitable for your video. The keyword list is based on YouTube’s search tool in a way similar to what we described in the previous chapter. However, since the analysis is automated with the Keyword Tool, you can get a huge list in just a few seconds. This generator is especially useful when you are looking for long-tail keywords that attract niche audiences.</p><h4 id="2-Rapid-Tags"><a href="#2-Rapid-Tags" class="headerlink" title="#2. Rapid Tags"></a>#2. Rapid Tags</h4><p>This tool is a bit more sophisticated and includes some analytic features on top of tag generating capacities, allowing you to manage your channel more effectively. It’s completely automated, so you won’t have to do any heavy lifting on your own. Just type the URL of your video into the appropriate field and let Rapid Tags do the rest. You can easily switch between the Generator, Analyzer, Ranker, and Tracker tools, so you can acquire a complete picture of the suitability of each tag and a better understanding of the projected performance of your video.</p><p>Want more tools to generate YouTube tags? Check our picks of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best YouTube video tag generators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="3-BetterWaytoWeb"><a href="#3-BetterWaytoWeb" class="headerlink" title="#3. BetterWaytoWeb"></a>#3. BetterWaytoWeb</h4><p>While this free-to-use tool has a very simple interface and won’t require any background knowledge to use, it still provides valuable information. It can suggest suitable tags for your new video based on the main keyword you provide, speeding up your research considerably. It can also analyze the tags placed on an existing YouTube video, which is important for deducing how other authors working in the same category are optimizing their content.</p><h3 id="3-Study-Your-YouTube-Rivals’-Tags"><a href="#3-Study-Your-YouTube-Rivals’-Tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Study Your YouTube Rivals’ Tags"></a>3. Study Your YouTube Rivals’ Tags</h3><p>YouTube content authors can learn a lot by analyzing their top competitors. No matter what your videos are about, there are probably countless other creators that want to attract the same audiences as you. Only a tiny percentage of them will manage to gain significant viewership, and those are the ones you should be researching in detail.</p><p>If you are able to locate the most successful videos with content similar to yours you are already halfway to your goal, but one obstacle still remains. You can’t even see your competitor’s tags them when you click on their videos on YouTube. This type of information is not displayed, but some specialized solutions are able to reveal it upon request. Here is one YouTube certified analytic tool capable of doing that:</p><h4 id="1-VidIQ"><a href="#1-VidIQ" class="headerlink" title="1. VidIQ"></a>1. VidIQ</h4><p>Currently used to manage more than 30,000 YouTube channels, this powerful video marketing suite can also help with tag selection. It can enlarge your tag library by a factor of 10, and provide you with a direct comparison with your chief competitors. In addition to increasing your views, this app can help you monitor your visibility on social networks, and track detailed statistics that describe the performance of your video. In other words, this is a comprehensive package that will help you manage your channel in a professional way.</p><p>What’s your YouTube tag strategy?</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Tag-FAQs"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Tag-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: YouTube Tag FAQs"></a>Part 2: YouTube Tag FAQs</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-YouTube-Tag"><a href="#1-What-is-YouTube-Tag" class="headerlink" title="1. What is YouTube Tag?"></a>1. What is YouTube Tag?</h4><p>YouTube tag is a keyword that you added to help Google and YouTube understand your video context, which is an important ranking factor in YouTube searching. Basically, the better you tag your video, the more views you can get. But you should keep in mind that adding excessive tags to your video description is against YouTube policy.</p><h4 id="2-How-Many-Tags-Should-You-Use-on-YouTube"><a href="#2-How-Many-Tags-Should-You-Use-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="2. How Many Tags Should You Use on YouTube?"></a>2. How Many Tags Should You Use on YouTube?</h4><p>Though there is no restriction about the numbers of the YouTube tags, you should keep the total characters of all tags within 400 characters. In most cases, 5-8 tags are appreciated for a YouTube video. It is recommended to add as many relevant tags as you can, such as brand-specific tags, YouTube auto-suggest tags, or tags created with some tag generator.</p><h4 id="3-Do-Tags-on-YouTube-Get-More-Views"><a href="#3-Do-Tags-on-YouTube-Get-More-Views" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Tags on YouTube Get More Views?"></a>3. Do Tags on YouTube Get More Views?</h4><p>The short answer is Yes. Since Google is encouraging people to use tags to help them understand your video content, then it can recommend the videos to relevant users accordingly. With tags, YouTube can categorize your videos and make them discoverable easier. For example, when you search tag #FilmoraSchoolStory in YouTube, you can see all the videos with the tag in the search result. allowing viewers to find your content more easily.</p><h4 id="Retouch-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Retouch-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Retouch YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Retouch YouTube Videos with Filmora</h4><p>There are lots of filters, overlays and effects pre-programmed in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora video editor

That doesn’t mean you have to take out a loan and spend thousands to purchase a brand new camera and all other gadgets that professional filmmakers use.</p><p>The smartest way to get started is to go through a list of <strong>necessary equipment for YouTube</strong> and check whether or not you already own some of it. Once your channel starts growing, you can then start thinking about whether you want to invest in upgraded equipment. Here is a quick overview of all items that you need to start entertaining your online audience and gaining subscribers to your YouTube channel:</p><ul><li><a href="#camera">Your YouTube Camera</a></li><li><a href="#mic">Microphones and Audio</a></li><li><a href="#light">Lighting Gear for YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#tripod">Tripods and Camera Stands</a></li><li><a href="#phone">Smartphone Camera Gear</a></li></ul><h2 id="YouTube-Cameras"><a href="#YouTube-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Cameras"></a>YouTube Cameras</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Use whatever you already have, even if it’s your phone or webcam. It’s nice to have sharp, fine-tuned, 4K footage, but viewers will forgive lower visual quality if your content is good.</p><p><strong>The long version: You</strong> will need a camera, but there are a lot of different devices you can use including DSLRs, point and shoots, webcams, and your smartphone.</p><p>Your choice of camera will have a tremendous impact on the visual quality of your content and might drive your decisions regarding other pieces of equipment. However, you shouldn’t feel obliged to work with a top-notch camera from day one, especially since cheaper options can produce great results if used the right way.</p><p>On one end of the spectrum, you have basic smartphone cameras and web cameras, which are easy to come by and simple to operate. These days, high-end phones come equipped with quite powerful cameras that are more than sufficient for the needs of the average YouTuber. Better webcams can also do the job, although high-performance webcam models can get pretty expensive too. It is probably wise to resist the urge to start broadcasting with the built-in camera in your laptop and at least get a webcam or use your phone, but your computer’s camera is still always an option. Not having a better camera should never stop you from making YouTube videos.</p><p>If you already have a DSLR camera then it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with it. You have far more freedom to adjust the settings and achieve a professional look for your videos with a DSLR, but that does mean it’ll take some time to become an expert at using it. Ultra-high resolution is not required for YouTube, but it certainly won’t hurt to have additional sharpness and more detail in the scene. If you’re shopping for a DSLR, look for one with a flip screen that allows you to quickly check what your viewers see.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio"><a href="#YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphone and Audio"></a>YouTube Microphone and Audio</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Audio quality is extremely important. If you can buy either a new camera or an external microphone, but not both, it might be better to go for the microphone. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here for advice on upping your audio quality without an external microphone. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Sound capturing is every bit as important for your success as your video feed. In fact, poor audio can be even more damaging to your subscriber count than grainy video, since people won’t spend their time listening to something they have to put effort into understanding.</p><p>Again, most YouTube video makers have a limited budget at their disposal, so professional microphones are mostly off the table. However, investing in a directional microphone (‘shotgun mic’) that can pick up your voice clearly and without background noise is certainly a smart move. Such microphones can be pointed towards you while you speak, and since most YouTubers sit still while doing their shows there won’t be too much need for in-session adjustments.</p><p>If you’re not ready to invest in a shotgun mic, you can also find very inexpensive (often under $20) LAV mics. These small microphones can be pinned to your shirt, which allows them to record very clear dialogue because they’re so close to your mouth.</p><h2 id="Lights-for-YouTube"><a href="#Lights-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Lights for YouTube"></a>Lights for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need as much light as you can get. Lighting kits can be affordable on Amazon, but you can also achieve a great look using daylight&#x2F;windows and ‘daylight’ lightbulbs.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> If you’ve ever tried to make a video indoors, you already know that it’s necessary to have additional light. Often just filming with the normal lights in a room will cause your footage to look dark and grainy, and possibly be tinted orange. To overcome these problems you need to increase the amount of light you have available.</p><p>Sometimes, it is enough to film near windows and&#x2F;or bring more household lamps into your filming area. For any household lamps or lighting fixtures you use, make sure to put in white or ‘daylight’ lightbulbs instead of using the orange&#x2F;tungsten bulbs that you might have for everyday use (this is how you avoid tinting things orange).</p><p>If you have the budget available to get some lighting equipment, you can find softbox lights or LED panel lights available fairly inexpensively online. Softbox lights are great because they provide even, diffused, light.</p><p>Another useful piece of lighting equipment to have is a reflector. A reflector is usually a piece of white, silver, or gold fabric stretched over a frame. You can use it to bounce light from one light source back towards yourself (this is a great way to fill shadows cast by your main light). Reflectors tend to be inexpensive, but you can also use white cardboard or tinfoil in place of purchasing a reflector.</p><h2 id="Tripods-and-Camera-Stands"><a href="#Tripods-and-Camera-Stands" class="headerlink" title="Tripods and Camera Stands"></a>Tripods and Camera Stands</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need something to hold your camera. If you mostly film in your own home that can be a desk or a stack of books, but if you make a lot of videos while you’re on the go you probably need a tripod or gimbal. Heavier cameras need heavier tripods.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> While handheld cameras can deliver solid results for vloggers and casual streamers, viewers do expect reasonably stable footage. For many types of videos, the camera needs to be completely still and flatly positioned on a horizontal plane. Tripods and camera stands can cost very little, so it’s a good idea to look into getting some kind of stabilizer.</p><p>When you are choosing a tripod, pay attention to how much it weighs. If the camera that needs to be mounted on it is very heavy (like some DSLR models), you want to ensure that the structure itself weighs enough not to be easily tipped over. Too thin tripods can put your camera at risk, and that’s the last thing you want. Smaller cameras such as GoPros are more flexible in this regard and can be placed on a wider range of tripods.</p><p>Even if you are using a phone or a webcam to record YouTube videos, you should consider mounting the device on a stable stand. It is possible to find mini tripods ideal for smartphones for as little as $10. These tripods are small enough to carry in your pocket, so you will be prepared to start making a video no matter where your adventures take you. If you are using a web camera, you should attach it to the stand so that it won’t move accidentally after you touch the surface it is placed on.</p><h2 id="Smartphone-Camera-Gear"><a href="#Smartphone-Camera-Gear" class="headerlink" title="Smartphone Camera Gear"></a>Smartphone Camera Gear</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-gear.jpg"                      alt="Smartphone Camera Gear"                ></p><p><strong>The short version:</strong> There’s a lot of gear out there designed with smartphone photos and videos in mind, including clip-on lenses, tripod mounts, phone-mounted LED lights, and inexpensive microphones that plug into the audio jack.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Recording your videos with a mobile phone can be a good decision. It all depends on the phone you have and the range of add-ons and apps that you complement it with. Almost every high-end model released in the past five years can shoot videos in 1080p or higher. Some can even produce 4K footage. If you perfect your smartphone filming technique, your YouTube videos could look as if they were made with pro equipment.</p><p>On the flip side, smartphone cameras typically perform poorly in low light. It is possible to download an app that lets you play around with settings to overcome this, but a phone-mounted LED light is probably a better solution. An external microphone might also be a necessity, but there are some good (inexpensive) options that can simply be plugged in through the headphone jack.</p><p>Another common downside of smartphone cameras is that most of them use digital zoom, which is vastly inferior to optical zoom. If you intend to shoot anything that’s further away than a few feet, you need a clip-on lens that goes on top of the built-in camera. This inexpensive device will give you a lot of freedom to work in space, and allow you to make spectacular shots even without high-end YouTube equipment.</p><h2

Not Everyone Who Clicks Adds to Your View Count</h2><p>YouTube doesn’t provide a clear definition of what counts as a view, but we know that someone clicks on your video, and clicking right away doesn’t count. That’s how we know that watch time is a factor. Some studies conclude that a <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/library/social-video-metrics/#9" >full 30 seconds need to be viewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to register as one view, but there is no way to know for sure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-youtube-count-view.JPG"                      alt="how YouTube counts view"                ></p><h2 id="2-How-Does-YouTube-Count-Views"><a href="#2-How-Does-YouTube-Count-Views" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does YouTube Count Views?"></a>2. How Does YouTube Count Views?</h2><p>YouTube wants to be sure that views are coming from humans and not bots. So, during the first couple of hours after you publish a video, YouTube seems to be stricter about what they count. The views which are counted are the ones that YouTube believes to be legitimate. Sometimes, it ends up skipping legitimate views for the sake of discretion.</p><p>Once this window of time passes, it is likely that you will see the view counter start to update a lot more frequently. The counter could still revert to updating slower and more hesitantly, though, if YouTube’s algorithm thinks it’s detecting something fishy.</p><p>At times, your view count can even be frozen temporarily until the algorithm can validate the views you are receiving. This is done to ensure a fair and positive experience for everyone who creates content. View counts can be adjusted by the algorithm in either direction.</p><p>You May Also Like:<br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >5 Tips To Get More Views With YouTube Optimization [Free Checklist] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="3-How-Does-YouTube’s-View-Count-Algorithm-Work"><a href="#3-How-Does-YouTube’s-View-Count-Algorithm-Work" class="headerlink" title="3.

How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?</h2><p>Termed by many as one of the most boggling algorithms of all time, it is really hard to decode the complete dynamics of the YouTube view count algorithm.</p><p>There are some tests you can run yourself to try to unpack it.</p><p>If you upload a video and then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >set it as unlisted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it won’t get any public views so you can experiment by doing things like watching for different lengths of time and seeing what gets counted.</p><p>You’ll have to use a computer in a different location and make sure the account is not the same as the one you used to upload the video. Now, you need to watch the video for roughly 15 seconds. The key here is to keep it less than 30 seconds. You will see that the view did not add to the count. If you repeat this process on multiple computers at varying locations and with different accounts and you are likely to find the same result.</p><p>However, if you watch it for 30 seconds or longer it is likely that the count will go up.</p><p>We are adding ‘likely’ here because, despite this 30-second rule which has been decoded, there are other factors that might contribute to whether a view is counted as well as other automated scanning techniques at play.</p><p>Try to watch the same video numerous times in a single day. You will find that the count will add up at first, but after some time it will stop. YouTube knows that a lot of times people replay some videos over and over when they really enjoy them, and so they want to factor replays into their algorithm because they suggest quality. However, to avoid spam views, the counter will stop after a certain point.</p><h2 id="4-Account-Tracking-Factors-Some-Viewers-Don’t-Count"><a href="#4-Account-Tracking-Factors-Some-Viewers-Don’t-Count" class="headerlink" title="4. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count"></a>4. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count</h2><p>Something else that can affect whether a view is counted is the behavior of the account which watches it prior to landing on your video’s watch page. Sometimes, YouTube might feel that there is an increased chance a particular account is actually a bot, and then views from that account might not be added.</p><p>One way that <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/27792330?hl=en" >YouTube might flag an account as a potential bot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is if it is jumping between videos directly without navigating through recommendations, the search engine, or the account’s subscriber feed (how are they getting between these watch page URLs if they aren’t clicking on anything YouTube can record?). To add to it, if the viewer is watching each of the videos for almost 30 seconds exactly (or less) there is an increased probability that it is not a human but a bot (or a human watching the bare minimum as part of a view exchange program).</p><p>Any bot-like action will result in an account’s views do not be added to your view count.</p><h2 id="5-The-Skip-Skim"><a href="#5-The-Skip-Skim" class="headerlink" title="5. The Skip &amp; Skim"></a>5. The Skip &amp; Skim</h2><p>It’s not uncommon for viewers to watch a video for say five seconds, skip forwards a bit and watch for another ten seconds as they look for a specific part. It is hard to say whether skipping through a video, but watching a scattered 30 seconds, would count as a view or not.</p><h2 id="6-Frozen-YouTube-View-Counts"><a href="#6-Frozen-YouTube-View-Counts" class="headerlink" title="6. Frozen YouTube View Counts"></a>6. Frozen YouTube View Counts</h2><p>Sometimes YouTube will freeze a view count in order to check that it is accurate. When the count is unfrozen, the count may jump up as views are validated or it can go down if YouTube detects a problem.</p><p>You can use <a class="link"   href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-analytics/" >YouTube’s analytics reports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to monitor an estimate of your potential views, but there is no assurance that this data will completely match your official view count.</p><h2 id="7-The-301-Mark"><a href="#7-The-301-Mark" class="headerlink" title="7. The 301 Mark"></a>7. The 301 Mark</h2><p>You may have seen a lot of videos that have a stagnant count of 301 views. The algorithm behind YouTube’s view counting system believes that any video which has fetched higher than 300 views has the ability to impact people’s perception of quality on YouTube. They do not want the homepage to be crowded with artificially popular videos.</p><p>This is why view counts are often frozen at 301. The employees at YouTube then manually verify whether the views obtained so far are legitimate or fake. Once the employees are sure that the views are legit, the counter is unfrozen and you will see an upward swing.</p><p>During the period when the view count is frozen every legitimate view is still counted, just not added immediately. Once the YouTube team is sure that your videos are not getting fake traffic, your view count will be updated to include views that were registered during the frozen phase. However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9100759/youtube-301-view-count-freeze-going-away" >YouTube says <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it won’t flag videos at 301 views anymore.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In short, we know YouTube expects a viewer to watch a video for around 30 seconds before it counts a view, that views from suspicious accounts are not counted, and that YouTube can decide to freeze your view count while they review your views. They are protecting the site from becoming saturated with videos that only look popular because of bots. Ultimately, ‘how does YouTube count views’ isn’t a question anyone but YouTube can answer for sure, but we do know it isn’t as simple as ‘a view is someone clicking on your video’.</p><p>If you want to engage your audience with cool effects and Filmora is the best choice to make a split-screen and green screen video for YouTubers.

But, slow down, you have to edit all your clips together first. And then you have to export your video from the editing program, which can take a while. Then you have to wait for it to upload to YouTube, and once it’s up you have to write your description, add cards, and do a handful of other things.</p><p>The period between finishing a video and actually posting it for your subscribers to see can be long and tiresome. A lot of videos have probably died in these stages because their creators ran out of energy and patience.</p><p>Don’t let this happen to your videos! Here are 4 ways you can save time and avoid headaches during post-production:</p><p><a href="#miniproject">1. Create mini-projects</a></p><p><a href="#optimize">2. Optimize your upload speed</a></p><p><a href="#descriptiontags">3. Use default descriptions and tags</a></p><p><a href="#tubebuddy">4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</a></p><h2 id="1-Create-mini-projects"><a href="#1-Create-mini-projects" class="headerlink" title="1. Create mini-projects"></a>1. Create mini-projects</h2><p>When you have a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >large editing project <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with lots of different titles, animations, clip sequences, and PIP tracks it can get hard to keep track of everything. That’s especially true if you need to go back and make changes. A change to one part of your video could affect other parts of it.</p><p>Also, the more complex your video is the longer it will take to render&#x2F;export.</p><p>There is a way you can keep your project more organized, save time making minor adjustments, and speed up rendering: create sub-projects of different segments of your video and import them into your main project as their own clips.</p><p>This helps you in 3 ways:</p><p>1. If there are a lot of effects it’ll be faster to render a shorter video.</p><p>2. If you import your sequence as its own clip you won’t have to worry about adjusting little parts of it whenever you change earlier sections of your video.</p><p>3. If you do want to make adjustments to your sequence you can open up your mini-project and change it without affecting anything in your main project.</p><h2 id="2-Optimize-your-upload-speed"><a href="#2-Optimize-your-upload-speed" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize your upload speed"></a>2. Optimize your upload speed</h2><p>At home, your videos will upload fastest if all of your internet resources are devoted to the upload. That means you should not have any other windows open on your computer while you are uploading. You should also make sure there aren’t other devices competing for wifi like smart tvs, cell phones, or really fancy coffee makers.</p><p>If you have neighbors on the same wifi signal as you and they are online at the same time, this will slow you down too.</p><p>Because there is so much that can interfere with wifi, you might want to consider a wired Ethernet cable. Ethernet connections are faster in general, and you won’t have any problems with other devices competing for resources like you get with wifi.</p><p>If you’re doing everything you can to optimize your upload speed at home and still find that it takes an unreasonable amount of time to upload videos to YouTube, go somewhere with a better connection. Save your video to a USB drive and take it to a library or college to upload. Connections in these kinds of places tend to be very strong.</p><h2 id="3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags"><a href="#3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Use default descriptions and tags"></a>3. Use default descriptions and tags</h2><p>In your <strong>Creator Studio</strong>, go to <strong>Channel &gt; Upload</strong> <strong>defaults</strong>. Here you can write in titles, descriptions, and tags which will automatically be applied to every video you upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-youtube-defaults.jpg"                      alt="Creator Studio Upload Defaults"                ></p><p>Note: in the latest YouTube Studio, the upload interface is changed but the main process is similar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Upload video in YouTube Studio"                ></p><p>You probably have tags you use for almost every video you post. For example, if your channel is about vegan cooking then every one of your videos is probably tagged ‘vegan’, ‘food’, and ‘cooking’. If you type those tags in here then you don’t have to keep adding them to every new video, and you can still add or remove tags from individual uploads so you aren’t stuck using the exact same set of tags every time.</p><p>Similarly, you probably have some default text that goes in the description of every one of your videos (i.e. a link to your personal website or a brief introduction of yourself). If you type in a default description then that text will appear automatically in every new video description and you can just add to it when you need to for individual videos.</p><p>Using defaults might only save you a couple of minutes per video, but those minutes add up.</p><h2 id="4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools"><a href="#4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools" class="headerlink" title="4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools"></a>4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</h2><p>TubeBuddy is a channel management tool for YouTube. Most of its features are more geared towards very large channels or companies with a YouTube presence, but there are also features that can help small or mid-sized YouTubers save time and stay organized.</p><p>Some of these tools include templates for things like cards and end screens and bulk processing tools for when you want to change a lot of things at once. For example, if you wanted to update the links in every card in every one of your videos at once then TubeBuddy could help with that.</p><p>Some of TubeBuddy’s best features for growing channels are the tagging features. TubeBuddy will help you discover tags, suggest new tags, and even copy whole lists of tags from rival videos.</p><p>There are different <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/pricing" >levels of pricing for TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (including a free version, although it’s very limited) and you get a discount on the Pro version if you have less than 50,000 lifetime views on your channel. It ends up being $4.50USD a month (or $3.60 USD a month if you pay for a year in advance). It’s a good investment for someone who’s starting to see some growth on YouTube, but probably not if you’re still trying to reach milestones like 500 subs or 10,000 views.</p><p>You have to work hard to get anywhere on YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you should be toiling away at tedious stuff like typing in the same tags over and over.

But if you don’t keep on top of it, your Watch Later list can quickly become unmanageable and cluttered with content that you no longer want to watch afterward.</p><p>If you are wondering how, you can declutter the playlist, we’ve got you covered. To help you with the task, we’ve compiled a comprehensive step-by-step guide. In this article, we will show you how to clear Watch Later on YouTube with just a few clicks.</p><p>So, without beating around the bush, let’s get started with our tutorial!</p><h2 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist</h2><p>If your YouTube Watch Later playlist is filled with videos you’ll never watch again, or you are not interested in that specific content type, you can quickly delete these videos at any time.</p><p>Here’s the step-by-step process on <strong>how to clear Watch Later on YouTube Web and App:</strong></p><h3 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-Web"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-Web" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On Web?"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On Web?</h3><p>You can delete the YouTube Watch Later Playlist on your desktop in the following ways:</p><h5 id="From-YouTube-Homepage"><a href="#From-YouTube-Homepage" class="headerlink" title="From YouTube Homepage"></a>From YouTube Homepage</h5><p>To clear the YouTube Watch Later Playlist from the YouTube Homepage, do the following steps:</p><p>Step1 First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/index?feature=signin"><strong>YouTube homepage</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Sign into your account if needed and click the <strong>“Library”</strong> option located at the left-hand side menu panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-youtube-web-library.png"                      alt="accessing the youtube web library"                ></p><p>Step2 Croll down and click the <strong>“See All”</strong> option under the Watch Later header. Click the <strong>Three Dots</strong> below the Watch Later playlist details on the next page.</p><p>Step3 From the drop-down menu, click <strong>“Remove Watch Videos.”</strong> This will instantly remove all the videos you’ve watched but are still in the playlist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/removing-watched-videos-from-youtube-watch-later.png"                      alt="removing watched videos from youtube watch later"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, to remove the unwatched videos, hover over a video and click the <strong>Three Dots</strong>. Select the <strong>“Remove from Watch Later”</strong> option to delete the video. You can repeat this process to remove all the content from the playlist until it is decluttered at the point of your satisfaction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clearing-the-youtube-watch-later-playlist.png"                      alt="clearing the youtube watch later playlist"                ></p><h5 id="Using-A-Script"><a href="#Using-A-Script" class="headerlink" title="Using A Script"></a>Using A Script</h5><p>Since the above process can be tiring, you can use a script to remove all the videos at once from the Watch Later playlist in the following way:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en%5Fpk/chrome/"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a> browser on your system and head to the <strong>YouTube</strong> website**.** Next, select the <strong>“Library”</strong> option in the left pane and click <strong>“Watch Later”</strong> from the menu.</p><p>Step2 Now, hit the <strong>“Ctrl + Shift + J”</strong> keys on Windows or the <strong>“Command + Option+ J”</strong> buttons on Mac to launch the developer mode and open the console window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-script-to-clear-watch-later.png"                      alt="using script to clear watch later"                ></p><p>Step3 Copy and paste the following lines of the script at the end of the line under the Console tab where the cursor is blinking.</p><p>setInterval(function () { document.querySelector(‘#primary button[aria-label&#x3D;”Action menu”]‘).click(); var things &#x3D; document.evaluate(‘&#x2F;&#x2F;span[contains(text(),”Remove from”)]‘, document, null, XPathResult.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE, null ); for (var i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; things.snapshotLength; i++) { things.snapshotItem(i).click(); } }, 1000);</p><p>Step4 In the last step, hit the <strong>“Enter”</strong> key to clear the Watch Later Playlist on YouTube. However, the process may take some time, depending on the number of videos in your playlist.</p><p>Although a bit tech-savvy, the script execution method is the most effective way to delete all Watch Later videos at once.</p><p>You can also replace the number at the end of the script with a lower entry to delete videos according to your preference. Also, choosing a lesser number can speed up the video deletion process from YouTube Watch Later list by a great deal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to note that experimenting with scripts is only for some. The script above has been confirmed to work, but others still need to be thoroughly checked and could potentially damage your computer. To prevent this from happening, only look for scripts from reliable sources instead of those posted by random people in various forums.</p><h3 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-YouTube-App"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-YouTube-App" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On YouTube App?"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On YouTube App?</h3><p>If you are using YouTube on an Android or iOS device, it is possible to clear the Watch Later Playlist by doing the steps below:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, <strong>swipe up</strong> on the Homescreen of your Android device or <strong>swipe right</strong> on your iOS device to launch App Drawer, and tap “<strong>YouTube”</strong> to launch the app.</p><p>Step2 Now, tap the <strong>“Library”</strong> option in the bottom-right corner of the screen and tap <strong>“Watch Later.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-watch-later-playlist.png"                      alt="accessing the watch later playlist"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, tap the three dots (vertical ellipses) icon on the top-right side of the screen and choose the <strong>“Remove Watched Videos”</strong> option to delete them from the playlist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clearing-watch-later-on-youtube-app.png"                      alt="clearing watch later on youtube app"                ></p><p>Step4 If there are still unwatched videos in the playlist, select a video and tap the three dots next to it.

The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

From there, click into the Analytics tab in the menu on the left of your screen.</p><p>In order to check which of your videos are performing the best, click on <strong>Watch time</strong> under <strong>Watch time reports</strong>. At the top of the page there’ll be a graph of your watch time in general, and if you scroll down you’ll see a list of your videos ranked by watch time. The best performing ones will be at the top and, to see more stats related to these high-performing videos, simply click on their titles. Afterwards, you’ll be able to click around the different sections in your Analytics and see reports relating to the specific video you clicked on.</p><p>The two main types of analytics reports are Watch Time Reports and Interaction Reports.</p><h3 id="1-Interpreting-YouTube-Watch-Time-Reports"><a href="#1-Interpreting-YouTube-Watch-Time-Reports" class="headerlink" title="1. Interpreting YouTube Watch Time Reports"></a>1. Interpreting YouTube Watch Time Reports</h3><p>To find <strong>Watch time reports</strong> you just need to log into your Google account, go to the <strong>Creator studio</strong>, click the analytics tab, and then click on <strong>watch time</strong>. You can see the watch time of every video on your channel, which is important data to have because watch time is the most important factor when it comes to ranking your video in search results.</p><p>A watch time report includes the total amount of time that your video, or a selection of videos, is actually being watched for. In order to make sure that you are publishing only quality videos you need to make sure that your viewers are consistently sticking to your videos and watching them all away through, or at least to the half-way mark. Watch time represents one of the most meaningful metrics in ensuring that you are engaging your audience.</p><p>YouTube analytics can now display a watch time of every video that you have produced. Seeing the metrics on how long people are actually watching every video that you produce can show you what you’ve done right in the past and what you need to do more of to continue raising your watch time.</p><p>Alongside watch time you can see the average duration individual viewers are watching your videos for. The average percentage of your video that gets viewed will showcase areas where you may be struggling with your video content. For example, if an abnormally high number of viewers are clicking away during your intro, there’s probably something about that clip that needs to be changed.</p><p>In the watch time reports for individual videos, you will be able to see data on where your views are coming from and which demographics are watching the most. Where your viewers are watching, in terms of desktop or mobile, is also interesting data that is available in this section.</p><p>Click here for more tips on <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/12-proven-ways-to-increase-youtube-views-315.html" >increasing your views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="2-Interpreting-YouTube-Interaction-Reports"><a href="#2-Interpreting-YouTube-Interaction-Reports" class="headerlink" title="2. Interpreting YouTube Interaction Reports"></a>2. Interpreting YouTube Interaction Reports</h3><p>Interaction reports are related to the actions viewers take – i.e. subscribing to your channel, liking your videos, or leaving a comments. You can find interaction reports in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics</strong>.</p><p>Interaction reports can be broken down into several different reports that can help determine the overall performance of any YouTube videos. The main interaction reports that you should be interested in include:</p><p><strong>1. Subscribers:</strong> You can find extensive data on your subscribers, like demographics including age groups and gender. Learning more about your subscribers can help you to tailor your content. For example, if you learn that your viewers are mostly young women under 24 in the USA, you can do research into what is currently popular with young women under 24 in the USA.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Want to see your subscriber count in real-time? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>2. Likes and dislikes:</strong> Likes and dislikes aren’t a powerful metric when it comes to search engine rankings, but they provide useful information to creators. If you’re getting a lot of dislikes on a video, you should look into why. If you’re getting a lot of likes on a video, it can indicate that you should focus on creating similar content.</p><p><strong>3. Playlists:</strong> A viewer watching a video in a playlist is much more likely to keep watching more videos from that playlist, making playlists great for the growth of your channel. Reports in this section will help you figure out which of your playlists is performing best, which could give you an idea of which types of videos or video topics are going over best with your viewers.</p><p><strong>4. Comments:</strong> Reading comments is a great way to figure out what your viewers think, but that’s not all they’re good for. If viewers return to a video to continue talking to you or other viewers then that will drive up your views and watch time. If a video is especially good at generating discussion, you should figure out why (i.e. your sign-off question) and keep doing it.</p><p><strong>5. Sharing:</strong> Discovering where your video is being shared can be important for figuring out what platforms you should be on besides YouTube. If your video is shared and viewed a lot on Twitter, you should consider making a Twitter account for your channel.</p><p><strong>6. Cards:</strong> Tracking the performance of your Cards will help you optimize them to direct traffic between your videos. By testing out different time stamps for cards you’ll find the perfect places to put them. By trying different messages in your cards you’ll learn how to write ‘calls to action’ that mobilize your viewers.</p><p><strong>End screens:</strong> End Screens are essential for keeping viewers on your channel. The report of the click-through rates of your end screens is important for helping you figure out which kinds of links work, and which style of ends screen is most effective for you. Are people more likely to click when you talk to them through the end screen, or when it’s a static card?</p><p><strong>7. 360 heat map reports:</strong> A heat map report works specifically with 360° videos if you are choosing to engage your audience with this type of content. Viewing YouTube video statistics for 360° heat maps will help to show the areas on your video that viewers are most interested in.</p><h2 id="How-to-View-Other-Peoples-YouTube-Statistics"><a href="#How-to-View-Other-Peoples-YouTube-Statistics" class="headerlink" title="How to View Other Peoples YouTube Statistics"></a>How to View Other Peoples YouTube Statistics</h2><p>If you want to check out the statistics of rival YouTube channels (<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-subscriber-chart---the-5-most-subscribed-youtube-channels-320.html" >including the most subscribed channels on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>), or channels you’re a fan of, try using <a class="link"   href="http://www.socialblade.com/" >Social Blade <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

The first 15 seconds of a video is when viewers are most likely to decide to click on one of the recommended videos, or go back to their search results and choose something else. The odds of them leaving within these first 15 seconds are greater if you do not get right to the main point of your video. That is why long intro sequences are bad for your watch time.</p><p>Whether it is better to put your intro at the very beginning of your video, or after you introduce your topic, will depend on your viewers. You may want to try it both ways and then look at your retention report (found in your YouTube Creator Studio under Analytics) to see which works best for you.</p><h4 id="Top-Intro-Sites"><a href="#Top-Intro-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Top Intro Sites"></a>Top Intro Sites</h4><p>There are a few different sites where you can download animated intros, customized to include your username or logo.

They only have two free options, though.</p><h4 id="Creating-an-Intro-in-Filmora"><a href="#Creating-an-Intro-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Creating an Intro in Filmora"></a>Creating an Intro in Filmora</h4><p>You can create a simple intro card in <strong>Filmora</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><ol><li>Choose your background. You may want to use a short clip as your intro, or you may just want a colored background.</li><li>Drag your clip or background into the video track of your timeline and trim it down to five seconds.</li><li>If you have a logo, import it into Filmora and drag it into your picture-in-picture track.</li><li>With your logo selected, click on the Green Screen icon. In the pop-up, select the background of your logo to make it transparent. For this to work your logo cannot be the same color as its background.</li><li>Click on the editing icon with your logo selected and choose an animation.</li><li>Go to the Text&#x2F;Titles menu and choose an animated title that suits your channel. Drag it into your text track and edit it to include your name.</li><li>The last piece of your intro is sound. You can choose a song from Filmora’s library and cut it down to five seconds, or import your sound effect.</li><li>Export your video and save it for use in all of your other videos.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-End-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-End-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: End Cards"></a>Part 2: End Cards</h2><p>When your video ends, YouTube will recommend a selection of videos users may want to watch next. Often, these recommendations will not include more of your videos.</p><p>To keep viewers on your channel, you can create your End Card which recommends other content you have created.</p><h4 id="Elements-of-an-End-Card"><a href="#Elements-of-an-End-Card" class="headerlink" title="Elements of an End Card"></a>Elements of an End Card</h4><p>An end card includes clips from two or three of your videos, muted, and shrunk down to thumbnail-size. Using spotlight annotations you can make these thumbnails click-able.</p><p>It is also important that your end card includes multiple calls to action. A call to action is meant to spur a viewer to some kind of action. Writing ‘Check out this video’ above one of your thumbnails is a call to action.</p><p>You should also have a subscribe link somewhere in your end card, ideally a very noticeable button with a proven call to action like ‘Subscribe Now!’.</p><p>Some creators will leave their end cards at that and play music overtop, but it can be even more effective to include a voiceover where you ask viewers to subscribe and watch your other videos.</p><h4 id="How-To-Make-an-End-Card"><a href="#How-To-Make-an-End-Card" class="headerlink" title="How To Make an End Card"></a>How To Make an End Card</h4><ol><li>Choose a static background. You may want to download an end card template or create one in a drawing program. If you do, make sure to include calls to action like ‘Watch more!’ and ‘Subscribe’.</li><li>Drag your background into your timeline at the end of your video.</li><li>Import two or three of your previous videos and drag them into your picture in picture tracks. Each clip should be on its track.</li><li>Trim the clips in your picture in picture track down to the same length as your end card.</li><li>Shrink your clips down to thumbnail-size by dragging their corners in the preview window.</li><li>Position your clips so they are spaced evenly by dragging them in the preview screen.</li><li>Mute your clips.</li><li>If your background does not include any calls to action, choose a title from the <strong>Text&#x2F;Titles</strong> menu in Filmora and create at least two – one asking viewers to subscribe, and one asking them to watch your suggested videos.</li><li>Export your video from Filmora and upload it to YouTube.</li><li>Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> and select <strong>Annotations</strong> in the drop-down menu next to your video.</li><li>Go to your end card in the previewer, as that is where you want to add your annotations.</li><li>Click <strong>Add Annotation</strong> and add a spotlight annotation to your video. Stretch it over one of your thumbnails and then check the Link box under your Annotation’s timing. Insert a link to the video you are previewing.</li><li>Repeat for any other thumbnails. For your subscribe button, change where it said ‘Video’ to ‘Subscribe’ and enter your channel URL.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-strategies-to-maximize-mobile-income-from-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved  Strategies to Maximize Mobile Income From YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/mastering-fast-thumbnail-design-for-valorants-highlighted-screenshots-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Fast Thumbnail Design for Valorant's Highlighted Screenshots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-expanding-youtube-audience-through-perpetual-creative-commons/"><u>In 2024, Expanding YouTube Audience Through Perpetual Creative Commons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-pioneering-the-perfect-playlist-for-youtube-music-enthusiasts/"><u>[New] Pioneering the Perfect Playlist for YouTube Music Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/how-to-download-youtube-thumbnail-in-3-ways-onlinewinmac-for-2024/"><u>How to Download YouTube Thumbnail in 3 Ways [Online/Win/Mac] for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-improving-accessibility-with-on-screen-text-elements-on-youtube-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  Improving Accessibility with On-Screen Text Elements on YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-gamers-unleashed-top-10-female-youtubers/"><u>In 2024, Gamers Unleashed  Top 10 Female YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-optimize-content-collaboration-in-youtube-for-increased-engagement/"><u>In 2024, Optimize Content Collaboration in YouTube for Increased Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-lyrical-explanation-designer/"><u>In 2024, Lyrical Explanation Designer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/updated-the-essential-guide-to-blur-techniques-for-dynamic-artwork/"><u>[Updated] The Essential Guide to Blur Techniques for Dynamic Artwork</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-imovie-for-windows-top-replacement-options/"><u>New 2024 Approved IMovie for Windows Top Replacement Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-airplay-apps-in-infinix-note-30i-for-streaming-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 AirPlay Apps in Infinix Note 30i for Streaming | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-tiktoks-true-potential-with-apples-voice-activated-system/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking TikTok's True Potential with Apple's Voice-Activated System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-delete-gmail-account-withwithout-password-on-oppo-a79-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Delete Gmail Account With/Without Password On Oppo A79 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-finding-the-right-mic-a-guide-for-multifaceted-yt-channels-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Finding the Right Mic  A Guide for Multifaceted YT Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/in-2024-sonic-injury-a-compilation-of-terrifying-noise-samples-for-entertainment/"><u>In 2024, Sonic Injury A Compilation of Terrifying Noise Samples for Entertainment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-turbocharge-fb-video-speed-selective-extensions-and-apps-guidebook/"><u>2024 Approved  Turbocharge FB Video Speed  Selective Extensions & Apps Guidebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-pokemon-go-error-12-failed-to-detect-location-on-oppo-k11-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Pokemon Go Error 12 Failed to Detect Location On Oppo K11 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-methods-to-unlock-the-iphone-locked-to-owner-for-iphone-7-plus-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, The Best Methods to Unlock the iPhone Locked to Owner for iPhone 7 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
