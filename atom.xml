But if you want to earn money from YouTube truly, you need to understand which monetization methods work best for you and your content.</p><p>Here’s what you should know when using each method and why you should consider doing so:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Methods</strong></th><th><strong>Viewers&#x2F;Clicks&#x2F;Impressions</strong></th><th><strong>Earnings&#x2F;Commission</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>YouTube Ads $1 CPM</strong></td><td>1 million Ad views</td><td>Average rate per ad&#x3D;0.18Total ~ $5000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Brand Sponsorships</strong></td><td>5K Sub 5K-30K Sub 30K-500K Sub 500K-1M+ Sub</td><td>$300 $700 $950 $3500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Affiliate Marketing 30%-35% commission</strong></td><td>If 100 people buys $20 product through affiliate link.

The moving digital images have enabled us to produce content of the highest quality and to create far-reaching video marketing campaigns that leave the viewers breathless. Some estimations say that by the end of this decade videos will claim the majority of the Internet traffic, which means that video promotion is the future of advertising.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.pointvisible.com/blog/video-marketing/" >Video content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> such as Explainer videos, Demonstration videos or Testimonial videos have proven to be an effective tool for improving an overall performance of companies because they build trust. 98% of people say that they first watch explainer videos to find out more about a company, before choosing to use its services. Let’s dive into the futuristic world of social video marketing.</p><p>Don’t miss out on more startling facts about Social Video Marketing featured in our Infographics because they will give you an insight into the future of online marketing. Scroll down and learn all you need to know about the latest trends that will make your company a smashing success.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-marketing-tips-for-small-business-in-2017.jpg"                      alt="video marketing tips for small business in 2017"                ></p><h3 id="Reasons-to-Use-Videos-for-Product-or-Brand-Promotion"><a href="#Reasons-to-Use-Videos-for-Product-or-Brand-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="Reasons to Use Videos for Product or Brand Promotion"></a>Reasons to Use Videos for Product or Brand Promotion</h3><p>The modern market demands a strategy that will present your brand and its services in a flattering light because if your public image doesn’t seem trustworthy, your potential business partners might opt to use the services of your competitors. Including an Explainer video on the homepage of your company’s website may increase conversion rates up to 80%, because it will enable you to share the values that are essential for your brand with each and every visitor to your website.</p><p>Furthermore, we all know how important Google Search Rankings are for the online visibility of products, companies and anything else on the Internet. Videos can increase your’ company’s chances to land on the first page in the Google searches by 53%, which means that your concerns about search rankings on Google can be reduced by producing engaging and fun to watch promotional videos.</p><p>Digital video content can be easily uploaded to video sharing platforms and distributed across social networks, and if the videos are engaging enough, even 76% of users will share your branded content. Well-crafted, skillfully written and produced videos will catch the eye of the public which is exactly what companies that want to grow more popular need.</p><h3 id="The-Perks-of-Unique-Content"><a href="#The-Perks-of-Unique-Content" class="headerlink" title="The Perks of Unique Content"></a>The Perks of Unique Content</h3><p>Thinking that all videos are the same, is perhaps the biggest misconception you can have about social video marketing. The type of the video you’ll need to produce in order to attract the attention to your company’s services is directly related to the content you want to feature in that video. Demonstration videos are perfectly suited for display of the product’s capabilities, while customer testimonials will enable you to share first-hand experiences of your loyal customers with the rest of the world.</p><p>Everyone wants to hear a tale well told, and choosing the Internet as a place where your videos will be shown is the right choice, since 39% of company executives will call the service provider after watching a video that tells the story of your brand. Business relies on trust, which makes establishing a strong connection to your target group all the more important, and moving images are much more likely to establish that connection than written content. Furthermore, an average Internet user spends 16 minutes per day watching online video ads, make sure that at least one minute belongs to you, through unique and thought-provoking content.</p><h3 id="Social-Media-as-Means-of-Reaching-Larger-Audiences"><a href="#Social-Media-as-Means-of-Reaching-Larger-Audiences" class="headerlink" title="Social Media as Means of Reaching Larger Audiences"></a>Social Media as Means of Reaching Larger Audiences</h3><p>If no one knows about your brand, then it is hard to sell the services you are offering, regardless of how world-changing they are. Social media has allowed us to have our voices heard around the world, which is the reason why all companies that aim to increase their sales should use it to distribute their video content.</p><p>YouTube has recently reported that mobile video consumption has increased by 100% each year in the last several years. This fact proves that reaching people wherever they are is no longer a dream.

If your YouTube videos get flagged for copyright issues relating to the background music or film clips it can be frustrating, especially if you receive a copyright notice for using royalty-free music you have a license for. Rather than feeling as though your creativity is being restrained, read this article to better understand the reasons copyright issues come up and what can be done to resolve them. Disputing copyright claims is something that any YouTuber can do.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1：-What-is-a-Content-ID-Claim-and-Why-Have-I-Received-One"><a href="#Part-1：-What-is-a-Content-ID-Claim-and-Why-Have-I-Received-One" class="headerlink" title="Part 1： What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One?"></a>Part 1： What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One?</h2><p>YouTube copyright issues often come up as a result of content ID claims. This will prompt Google support to deliver a copyright notice to your account. Content ID claims are generally made against content that contains material that should not be available on YouTube. Claims are often issued if you don’t own the music, movie clips, TV clips, express rights to showcase cut scenes in video games, or other copyrighted media.</p><p>If you happen to see that a video has been muted or taken down you can visit the copyright notices section of your video manager to learn more. In this section you will learn more about what will be done as a result of the content ID claim.</p><p>Generally, a content ID claim does not put a YouTube channel in any kind of trouble. What usually happens is that the video is removed, you lose the ability to earn ad revenue from it, or the sound is muted so the copyrighted music no longer plays.</p><p>In some cases, the owner of the copyrighted content (usually musical artists) may choose to allow you to keep your video up in exchange for running their ads.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Dealing-With-a-Copyright-Claim-on-Your-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Part-2-Dealing-With-a-Copyright-Claim-on-Your-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video"></a>Part 2: Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video</h2><p>If you have received copyright claims there are ways that you can get your content put back up in its original condition.</p><p>First, you could purchase the rights to use the copyrighted media after your video has been flagged or try getting express permission from the content creator to use aspects of their content in your own original video.</p><p>Sometimes, your videos may be flagged even though you’ve already purchased the license for the copyrighted music, images or clips you are using.</p><p>YouTube’s robots automatically scan through the database of audio and visual content that is put up by copyright owners. Any video that has been uploaded to YouTube with this copyrighted content will receive a third-party copyright notice. Because flagging happens automatically it often affects creators who have licenses for the royalty-free music, or other copyrighted material, they are using.</p><p>The good news is that this same level of protection will ensure that your own original content can also be protected from reuse if you register it.</p><p>In order to dispute a copyright claim on your video the first thing that you will need is some proof that you have purchased the rights to the music or other content that is being reused in your video. If you have a direct link to the online license agreement this can help with the dispute process. Purchasing a license online for royalty-free music or other content is usually fairly simple and with a PDF license certificate you can quickly dispute copyright content ID claims.</p><p>You can upload your license document to the file sharing system Dropbox to make the content public for YouTube admins to check over. Heading over to your video manager on YouTube and sending a message link with the dispute and link to your license will make sure that your explanation is heard. Sending the license, written permission, or a link to the legal license will result in YouTube reinstating your video.</p><p>Most of the time the only information that you need to use is where the license was purchased as well as the link to where the copyright license document can be accessed.</p><p>After submitting your dispute YouTube admins will often take a few business days to get back to you with an answer.

I’m a Social Worker, which means I’m always juggling my time between conducting home visits, returning phone calls and emails, and round-the-clock documentation on my clients. YouTube can be a great source of passive income, but it takes time before you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization---the-ultimate-guide-to-ad-revenue-422.html" >make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>I’ve had to put a lot of effort into staying consistent with my YouTube channel. Through trial and error, I’ve learned some things that have worked tremendously, while others have been epic fails.</p><p>So, to save you and your viewers some of the same struggles, here are 5 tips I recommend for keeping your channel running successfully and having work-life balance!</p><p><a href="#specificdays">1. Don’t force yourself to post on specific days</a></p><p><a href="#notebook">2. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner</a></p><p><a href="#weather">3. Check the weather forecast in advance</a></p><p><a href="#createvideos">4. Create 3-5 videos in advance</a></p><p><a href="#createaudio">5. Be creative!

Don’t force yourself to post on specific days"></a>1. Don’t force yourself to post on specific days</h2><p>I know what you’re thinking - “What?! That’s insane.” The first piece of advice I received about YouTube was to create a schedule of days to post so your viewers look forward to videos. That just doesn’t work for me. Whenever I became too busy with work, I couldn’t stick to my typical Tuesday or Thursday schedule. I think it’s best to focus on how many times you can post in a week rather than a specific day. I try to post at least once a week and that’s my goal. You can always increase as your workload gets lighter or you when you are able to do YouTube full-time.</p><h2 id="2-Keep-track-of-all-your-ideas-in-one-notebook-planner"><a href="#2-Keep-track-of-all-your-ideas-in-one-notebook-planner" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner"></a>2. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner</h2><p>A notebook planner is essential for keeping my life organized and on track. When I first started my channel, I had a separate planner just for my YouTube videos – this didn’t work cause I never looked at it. It worked best when I kept track of my entire life, including YouTube, in one planner since I look at it every day. Then I could also see which days I wanted to post a video or see what topics worked best around specific holidays and such.</p><h2 id="3-Check-the-weather-forecast-in-advance"><a href="#3-Check-the-weather-forecast-in-advance" class="headerlink" title="3.

Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan.

Test video duration"></a>a. Test video duration</h3><p>Nobody likes to see a 2 hour long YouTube video unless it’s super interesting. Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p><p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p><p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p><p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p><p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk.

These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p><p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p><p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format.

The main goal of YouTube SEO is to rank high for specific keywords in search engines. As such, it is crucial to know how YouTube SEO works if you want to boost the ranking of your videos.</p><p>Whether you are a blogger, market researcher, or video marketer, you need YouTube SEO to generate traffic to your videos. YouTube SEO involves optimizing your videos, channel, descriptions, metadata, and playlists. You can optimize videos for search within and outside YouTube.</p><p>Because search engine bots can’t watch YouTube videos, they depend on accompanying text data when indexing them.

Here are eleven YouTube SEO tips that will help you to boost your video ranking.</p><h4 id="1-Conduct-Keyword-Research-First"><a href="#1-Conduct-Keyword-Research-First" class="headerlink" title="1. Conduct Keyword Research First"></a>1. Conduct Keyword Research First</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-1.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - conduct keywords reseaerch first"                ></p><p>When it comes to YouTube SEO, keywords are crucial. YouTube uses these keywords to determine the subject of your video, index the content, and then associate it with what users are searching for. As such, you must add them to certain fields, including description, tags, and title, when you are uploading the video file. YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.</p><p>For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title"><a href="#2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="2. Use a Good Video Title"></a>2. Use a Good Video Title</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-2.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - video title"                ></p><p>The title of your video is the first thing other people see, and it’s what decides whether or not they watch it. Given how important it is, you’ll want to make sure that your title accurately reflects the content of your video and includes all relevant keywords.</p><h4 id="3-Link-Your-Videos-Directly-to-Your-Website"><a href="#3-Link-Your-Videos-Directly-to-Your-Website" class="headerlink" title="3. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website"></a>3. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website</h4><p>Each time you publish a new video, make sure you embed it on your website or blog. Not only will this encourage viewers to stay on your website instead of leaving immediately, but it will also make it easier for search engines crawlers to index your website.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Tags-To-The-Video-Description"><a href="#4-Add-Tags-To-The-Video-Description" class="headerlink" title="4. Add Tags To The Video Description"></a>4.

You can do this by adding some relevant keywords with each tag like you would with blog posts.</p><p>When planning your strategy for YouTube keywords, you need to find 10-20 single keyword tags you want to rank for; keep in mind that this platform limits the number of tags users can include in a video. So you should first add the most relevant keyword phrases then include specific multi-word tags that will easily rank on top of search results.</p><h4 id="5-Edit-The-Filename"><a href="#5-Edit-The-Filename" class="headerlink" title="5. Edit The Filename"></a>5. Edit The Filename</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-4.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - edit the file name"                ></p><p>The filename of your video, or the “video URL,” can also affect its rankings. Including keywords in this section will help the crawlers index your video faster, which will increase its chances of ranking higher.</p><h4 id="6-Add-Subtitles-and-Closed-Captions"><a href="#6-Add-Subtitles-and-Closed-Captions" class="headerlink" title="6. Add Subtitles and Closed Captions"></a>6. Add Subtitles and Closed Captions</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-5.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - add subtitles and closed captions"                ></p><p>Adding subtitles and closed captions to your videos is also a good idea, especially if you want the video’s ranking and viewership to improve. Subtitles make it easier for new viewers to understand your videos, especially if your audience comes from different linguistic backgrounds.</p><h4 id="7-Select-Video-Category"><a href="#7-Select-Video-Category" class="headerlink" title="7. Select Video Category"></a>7. Select Video Category</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-6.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - select video category"                ></p><p>When uploading a video, be sure to select the most appropriate category for it. Essentially, this helps with SEO optimization because choosing the right category means that YouTube’s algorithm will place your video in the proper search results. In turn, viewers will easily find your video and watch it.</p><h4 id="8-Use-a-Compelling-Thumbnail"><a href="#8-Use-a-Compelling-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="8. Use a Compelling Thumbnail"></a>8. Use a Compelling Thumbnail</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-7.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - use compelling thumbnail"                ></p><p>Make sure you use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the right YouTube video thumbnail image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, as this makes a big difference in the click-through rate. You might want to use high-quality, high-contrast images with a 16:9 aspect ratio. YouTube will choose which frame it will display as the video thumbnail. The platform will present three screenshots that you can choose from; however, you can upload your image or select a shot of another moment in the video.</p><p>Remember that YouTube overlays the duration of the video in the corner of your thumbnail. So make sure it does not obstruct any relevant details in your thumbnail. Google also uses image recognition to filter out specific imagery, including the YouTube logo.</p><p>Ideally, you need an image that is a perfect visual representation of the keywords you are targeting. In turn, this is going to take your presence in relevant search results even further.</p><h4 id="9-Make-High-Quality-Longer"><a href="#9-Make-High-Quality-Longer" class="headerlink" title="9. Make High-Quality Longer"></a>9. Make High-Quality Longer</h4><p>Videos that are less than 2 minutes long often rank low. The duration of most of the videos in the first five positions is usually 11 minutes 44 seconds. Therefore, you need to invest in longer videos that are around 10 minutes long. These videos meet the expectations of many users seeking complete and in-depth content. Additionally, you should create high-quality videos to ensure your viewers will keep watching.</p><h4 id="Create-High-Quality-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Create-High-Quality-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Create High-Quality YouTube Video with Filmora"></a>Create High-Quality YouTube Video with Filmora</h4><p>Wondershare’s Filmora program allows you to edit your video content with trim, transitions, and overlays.

What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?"></a>3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?</h4><p>When a viewer clicks on your video their computer sends an encoded request through the internet to YouTube’s servers. After YouTube receives the play request it chooses which format to play the video in based on the viewer’s browser. Your video is again turned into packets, which are again sent as radio signals over the internet to your viewer. Your viewer’s computer or device reforms the packets into your video and their browser plays it.</p><p>If videos take a long time to load for you then there are a few things you can do to speed them up. First, consider changing the channel of your wifi router. Most people stay on the channel their router was set to when they first got it and so there is a good chance you and your neighbors are all on the same channel. This causes your networks to interfere with each other. You can also delete the temporary files on your computer. Besides helping you stream video faster this will free up storage space. Another thing you can do is make sure there are as few devices connected to your network as possible while you are watching videos. Besides mobile phones and laptops you may have appliances, like coffee machines and refrigerators, which are wifi enabled. Disconnect them temporarily and it will help your videos to load faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-comprehensive-report-on-djis-inspire-1/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Comprehensive Report on DJI's Inspire 1</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-cut-through-clutter-expert-tips-on-editing-overflowing-tiktoks/"><u>[New] In 2024, Cut Through Clutter Expert Tips on Editing Overflowing TikToks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-innovative-approaches-to-youtube-teaser-trailblazing/"><u>2024 Approved Innovative Approaches to YouTube Teaser Trailblazing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-of-engaging-moba-titles-on-android/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate List of Engaging MOBA Titles on Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/from-good-to-great-elevate-reactions-in-youtube-videos-with-these-3-strategies-for-2024/"><u>From Good to Great Elevate Reactions in YouTube Videos with These 3 Strategies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/harnessing-the-power-windows-11-and-high-dynamic-range-explained/"><u>Harnessing the Power: Windows 11 and High Dynamic Range Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-downgrade-iphone-15-pro-without-losing-anything-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Downgrade iPhone 15 Pro without Losing Anything? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-from-apple-iphone-12-pro-to-iphone-81111-pro-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer from Apple iPhone 12 Pro to iPhone 8/11/11 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-maximizing-online-presence-through-youtube-ad-and-image-marketing/"><u>In 2024, Maximizing Online Presence Through YouTube Ad & Image Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/master-your-thumbnails-with-these-20-top-fonts-for-2024/"><u>Master Your Thumbnails with These 20 Top Fonts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-fcpx-essentials-how-to-achieve-silky-smooth-video-playback/"><u>Updated In 2024, FCPX Essentials How to Achieve Silky Smooth Video Playback</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Firstly because it means you have to do all the work of shooting and editing every day and secondly because it means you need to have something to talk about every single day. Even vlogging once or twice a week is tough.</p><p>How do you know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what you should talk about in your vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? Some people are so comfortable in front of the camera they can just turn it on and start talking about whatever’s on their mind, but they’re in the minority.</p><p>Before starting your daily vlogging, you have to figure out one important thing ahead of time.</p><h2 id="Do-you-have-a-niche"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-niche" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a niche?"></a>Do you have a niche?</h2><p>  You should have a niche. In a genre as broad as vlogging it is important to have some kind of hook that sets you apart from other vloggers. This can be an interest that you have, an industry you work in, or even a field of study you’re involved in at school. If you’re into technology, for example, you’ll always have a wealth of subjects to vlog about because all you’ll have to do is look at the day’s tech news and make a video reporting and commenting on it.</p><p>The other reason it’s good to have a niche is that you’ll be able to use keywords related to that niche in your video titles and tags. It’s hard to make it with a vlogging channel because nobody is searching for your content unless you are covering a specific topic like the technology they want to hear about.</p><ul><li><a href="#watching">What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</a></li><li><a href="#snapshots">Snapshots of Your Day</a></li><li><a href="#get-out">Whatever You Need to Get Out</a></li><li><a href="#learn">What did you learn today?</a></li></ul><p>Here are 4 things to talk about in your daily vlog:</p><h2 id="What-are-you-watching-reading"><a href="#What-are-you-watching-reading" class="headerlink" title="What are you watching&#x2F;reading?"></a>What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</h2><p> If you’re really into a book or tv show, or if you saw a movie recently, then those are all good things to talk about (warn people if you’re going to spoil anything!). You do recaps, reviews, or just share a few thoughts you had. If you’re worried about alienating people who don’t watch&#x2F;read the same stuff as you then you can keep it more general and just react to a few things from the media you’re consuming while also talking about your day. It’ll give you an anchor to build the rest of your video around, even if it’s not all you talk about.</p><p>By commenting on what you’re watching&#x2F;reading you have a better chance of capitalizing on a trending topic people are searching for. You could also find yourself an audience by becoming involved in fan communities.</p><h2 id="Snapshots-of-Your-Day"><a href="#Snapshots-of-Your-Day" class="headerlink" title="Snapshots of Your Day"></a>Snapshots of Your Day</h2><p> Casey Neistat is the master of this. He is always ready with a camera on hand so that, when something interesting happens, he can capture it and build his daily vlog around it.</p><p>Carrying a camera around like Casey may or may not suit your lifestyle, but you can still pick out one story from your day to tell. It doesn’t have to be a major event, and you shouldn’t worry that it won’t be interesting to other people. It’s your personality they’re tuning in for, so even if you’re just talking about a funny thing your cat did it will keep your audience interested because a) it’s you talking about it and b) it gives them a bit of insight into your life.</p><h2 id="Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out"><a href="#Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out" class="headerlink" title="Whatever You Need to Get Out"></a>Whatever You Need to Get Out</h2><p><em>Flula is frequently puzzled by English expressions, like ‘Party Pooper’, and needs to get his confusion off his chest at odd hours of the day.</em></p><p> Ranting about people you know can get messy when people from your offline life see it, so maybe avoid that. However, if you’re angry about something in general – or really happy about something – then whatever it is you’re feeling strongly about is probably the thing you should be vlogging about.</p><p>It does not matter what it is that is making you have this strong reaction (unless, again, it’s an actual person who might see your video and cause problems for you). If you’re mad about a real injustice in the world then that’s a great thing to talk about – you might even raise some awareness for the issue – but you can also rant about your favorite flavor of yogurt being cut and that’ll be engaging to viewers too.</p><p>Alternatively: you could do a vlog about how happy you are to have gotten engaged or a vlog about how happy you are that it was sunny today, and your enthusiasm will carry your audience through either video with you.</p><h2 id="What-did-you-learn-today"><a href="#What-did-you-learn-today" class="headerlink" title="What did you learn today?"></a>What did you learn today?</h2><p> <em>Fun fact: The original lyrics Paul McCartney imagined for ‘Yesterday’ were ‘Scrambled eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs’.</em></p><p> You learn something new every day, right? Why not share that factoid with your viewers. Here a few facts to get you started:</p><p> Whales evolved from a land-based animal called a pakicetus.</p><p>The hagfish hunt by swimming into the mouth of a larger fish and eating it from the inside.</p><p>Crows live in family units, visit their aging parents, and have funerals for dead crows.</p><p>The puya chilensis is a plant that ‘eats’ sheep (sheep get stuck to it, starve, and end up as fertilizer).</p><p>Sea monkeys can survive in space.</p><h2 id="EVERYTHING"><a href="#EVERYTHING" class="headerlink" title="EVERYTHING"></a>EVERYTHING</h2><p>You could also just flick the camera on and tell the full story of your day like you’d do in a traditional daily blog. What did you have for breakfast, how was school&#x2F;work, did you talk to any friends, how was the weather – anything and everything. Generally, these videos can run a bit long and don’t have a lot of snappy editing. They’re faster to make, which is good if you’re doing them every day, but the unpolished nature of them won’t appeal to everyone.

Looking at channels that have millions of subscribers or videos that have God knows how many daily views may prompt you to start thinking about buying subscribers for your YouTube channel.</p><p>There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not this is a legitimate method of promoting the organic growth of your channel. A lot of people think buying subscribers and viewers is more damaging than it is helpful for YouTubers who opt to go down that road.</p><p>Before buying subscribers or views you first must make sure that the provider you’re considering doing business with is trustworthy. It may turn out that the service you purchased subscribers from is a scam designed to take your money. Besides being scammed, there are several other major concerns that make buying subscribers for your YouTube channel a questionable choice.</p><p>Let’s have a look at how buying subscribers may hurt your channel and ruin your chances of achieving YouTube success.</p><h2 id="The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned"><a href="#The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned" class="headerlink" title="The Odds of Getting Banned"></a>The Odds of Getting Banned</h2><p>If you’re considering buying subscribers, your most pressing question might be “Will I get banned?” This is completely within reason because your first concern should be to avoid being penalized by YouTube.</p><p>If YouTube’s algorithm catches you buying fake views, your video will be removed. We should specify that “fake views” means “views generated by a bot.”</p><p>Buying real human views is a bit of a grey area — not technically against the rules, but frowned upon and potentially risky if the delivery of the views results makes YouTube think you’re using a bot.</p><h4 id="What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views"><a href="#What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views" class="headerlink" title="What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views"></a>What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views</h4><p>If your video is removed for artificially inflating your view count you can try to restore it by filling out the <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168?hl=en" >YouTube View Abuse Appeal Form <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Looking at channels that have millions of subscribers or videos that have God knows how many daily views may prompt you to start thinking about buying subscribers for your YouTube channel.</p><p>There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not this is a legitimate method of promoting the organic growth of your channel. A lot of people think buying subscribers and viewers is more damaging than it is helpful for YouTubers who opt to go down that road.</p><p>Before buying subscribers or views you first must make sure that the provider you’re considering doing business with is trustworthy. It may turn out that the service you purchased subscribers from is a scam designed to take your money. Besides being scammed, there are several other major concerns that make buying subscribers for your YouTube channel a questionable choice.</p><p>Let’s have a look at how buying subscribers may hurt your channel and ruin your chances of achieving YouTube success.</p><h2 id="The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned-3"><a href="#The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned-3" class="headerlink" title="The Odds of Getting Banned"></a>The Odds of Getting Banned</h2><p>If you’re considering buying subscribers, your most pressing question might be “Will I get banned?” This is completely within reason because your first concern should be to avoid being penalized by YouTube.</p><p>If YouTube’s algorithm catches you buying fake views, your video will be removed. We should specify that “fake views” means “views generated by a bot.”</p><p>Buying real human views is a bit of a grey area — not technically against the rules, but frowned upon and potentially risky if the delivery of the views results makes YouTube think you’re using a bot.</p><h4 id="What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views-3"><a href="#What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views-3" class="headerlink" title="What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views"></a>What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views</h4><p>If your video is removed for artificially inflating your view count you can try to restore it by filling out the <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168?hl=en" >YouTube View Abuse Appeal Form <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Even if you manage to restore your video, your channel will get a red flag — not the kind you get for copyright violation, but an internal one that keeps the YouTube’s algorithm alert in case you try to do the same thing again.</p><p>Being caught more than once gaming the system may result in your videos being permanently removed or your channel being completely suspended. When providers of views and subscribers advertise their services as safe they are actually saying that their service will not raise red flags with YouTube’s algorithm.</p><p>The only way in which they can guarantee that is if they intend on delivering high retention views, which means that actual people will click on your video and watch it from the beginning until the end. There are services that have proven to deliver this level of quality, and if you are interested you should check out <a href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>Buy Views Review</strong></a>, which is a site that tests and rates these services.</p><p>Buying subscribers is riskier than buying views, but there are still some services that are better than others.</p><h4 id="What-to-Consider-When-Buying-YouTube-Subscribers-3"><a href="#What-to-Consider-When-Buying-YouTube-Subscribers-3" class="headerlink" title="What to Consider When Buying YouTube Subscribers"></a>What to Consider When Buying YouTube Subscribers</h4><p>While purchasing subscribers for a YouTube channel that doesn’t really make money is looked upon relatively lightly, buying views or subscribers to gain profit is an entirely different matter.</p><p>As you probably already know, YouTube videos are monetized through AdSense, which has far stricter rules about attempts to trick the system. Getting caught by AdSense may result in being banned from using AdSense, which means that your account will be suspended and you will not be allowed to open another account.</p><p>Buying fake views and subscribers to try and turn a profit involves a lot of risks, especially because the financial gain you will be able to make isn’t significant. There are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >other ways to make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than to get subscribers.</p><p>The best advice for YouTube creators who want to buy views and subscribers is to go through official channels. The reason for buying real views isn’t technically against the rules is because Google could be said to sell views itself through its ad services. Paying Google for YouTube views is highly unlikely to backfire on you, while you can also consider hiring freelancers to get you legitimate subscribers and views, the quality of their services can range from excellent to terrible and it will be hard to find reliable reviews.</p><h2 id="Other-Risks-of-Buying-Subscribers-3"><a href="#Other-Risks-of-Buying-Subscribers-3" class="headerlink" title="Other Risks of Buying Subscribers"></a>Other Risks of Buying Subscribers</h2><p>Besides getting into trouble with YouTube, there are other risks involved with buying subscribers.</p><p>The whole idea behind buying fake subscribers is to make your channel look more popular to attract real subscribers, but in order to attract real subscribers, your videos need to rank in YouTube’s search engine. There are legitimate optimization tactics that can help you do that, but it does require more patience.</p><p>The amount of time viewers spend watching your video is the most important statistic for determining how well ranked your videos are in search queries on YouTube and if you buy fake views or fake subscribers, the viewer retention rates will remain the same.</p><h4 id="Why-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-Are-a-Waste-of-Money-3"><a href="#Why-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-Are-a-Waste-of-Money-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Fake YouTube Subscribers Are a Waste of Money"></a>Why Fake YouTube Subscribers Are a Waste of Money</h4><p>Buying fake subscribers won’t help get your videos in front of real viewers.</p><p>Your channel and your videos will continue to perform poorly in the search results as long as the viewer retention rates remain low. This is because buying subscribers doesn’t mean that you will be buying views or watch time.</p><p>In most cases, subscribers who you have paid for will not watch your videos. If your subscriber count suddenly shoots up, but your view count and watch time does not reflect that growth, YouTube’s algorithm will pick up on that. You may not face any official disciplinary action, but the algorithm will ensure that your videos are ranked very low in search results making it impossible to grow.</p><h4 id="Alternative-to-Buying-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-3"><a href="#Alternative-to-Buying-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-3" class="headerlink" title="Alternative to Buying Fake YouTube Subscribers"></a>Alternative to Buying Fake YouTube Subscribers</h4><p>The best strategy is to grow your channel organically, even though it will take a lot of time. Create a community that loves and follows your work and you will never have to think about how to get fake subscribers.</p><p>If you would like to avoid even the slightest possibility of your channel getting hurt, create content that YouTube viewers will enjoy watching or find helpful, and keep making them consistently. It might take a long time, but you will start to see growth.</p><p>This is the best way to develop a loyal fan base that will help you get more subscribers. Views and subscribers you get from bot farms, which is where most of the bought subscribers and views come from, maybe excellent at imitating the human online behavior, but there will be consequences if you get caught.</p><p>Buying subscribers is unlikely to have a huge effect on the growth rate of your channel. Also, this method for increasing traffic on your channel will not take you a step closer to creating a community of subscribers who can’t wait to watch your next video, which should be the ultimate goal of every aspiring YouTube creator.</p><p>In conclusion, we don’t recommend that you buy fake YouTube subscribers.</p><h2 id="Make-Impressive-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora-to-Grow-Your-Subscriber-3"><a href="#Make-Impressive-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora-to-Grow-Your-Subscriber-3" class="headerlink" title="Make Impressive YouTube Video with Filmora to Grow Your Subscriber"></a>Make Impressive YouTube Video with Filmora to Grow Your Subscriber</h2><p>Since YouTube is a video platform, your video is what attracts your subscribers.

In this article, we will teach you about some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video formats and settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>To upload a video to YouTube you have to make sure that you are using one of the video file formats that is supported by the platform itself. Here they are:</p><p>  - MP4</p><p> - MOV</p><p> - AVI</p><p> - FLV</p><p> - 3GPP</p><p> - WMV</p><p> - WebM</p><p> - MPEGS</p><p> <strong>YouTube recommends uploading your videos as MP4 files.</strong> Some benefits of MP4s are that the files are not as large as AVIs, they provide better quality than FLVs, and they often display with the same quality or better as you would get watching the video on a native video player. Other file formats like 3GPP and MPEG-PS generally have resolutions too small for high-resolution tablets or desktop devices.</p><p>If your phone or video editing software does not output MP4 videos, consider getting video editing software or a conversion program that can (like Filmora Video Editor).</p><p>Filmora is an easy-to-use video editing program that can export to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, F4V, MKV, TS, 3GP, MPEG-2, WEBM, GIF, and MP3. You can convert a video to an MP4 simply by importing it into Filmora, dragging it into the timeline, and exporting it in the MP4 format.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Upload-Settings-for-YouTube"><a href="#The-Best-Upload-Settings-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="The Best Upload Settings for YouTube"></a>The Best Upload Settings for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The best video code:</strong></p><p><strong>The best video format:</strong> MP4</p><p>Audio should be produced using the LC format and stereo 5.1 or standard stereo. You can upload separate MP3 audio format files for voiceovers if you need to.</p><p>The aspect ratio for a video should be 16:9 so that it won’t have black bars on the side when uploaded to YouTube. YouTube has also made it possible for 9:16 (portrait) style videos to be viewed without black bars, full screen, using their iOS app.</p><p>You should export in at least 30 frames per second. Many creators push that to 60 frames per second, which is better for most types of videos (although it may not make a noticeable difference for others).</p><p>The maximum size for quick upload and load time on YouTube is generally under 2gb. Luckily MP4 offers a great degree of compression without sacrificing too much image quality.</p><p>If you scale down the file size of the video by reducing the resolution or choosing a format with more compression, that can cause you to lose quality. If you need a smaller file, it’s always better to scale down the length of a video rather than continually compress the file or lose frames from the video.</p><p>Although a 2 GB file of a very long will easily upload to YouTube, it will probably be very low quality.</p><p> Do you agree that MP4 is the best video format for YouTube, or do you use something else?</p><h2 id="Create-Stunning-Videos-with-a-High-Quality-Video-Editor"><a href="#Create-Stunning-Videos-with-a-High-Quality-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Create Stunning Videos with a High-Quality Video Editor"></a>Create Stunning Videos with a High-Quality Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-explore-the-world-of-frames-5-free-youtube-tips-for-you-for-2024/"><u>[New] Explore the World of Frames 5 Free YouTube Tips for You for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-smooth-and-simple-guide-to-iphone-screensaving-process/"><u>[New] Smooth & Simple Guide to Iphone Screensaving Process</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-experience-unparalleled-text-design-with-top-5-downloadable-platforms/"><u>[Updated] Experience Unparalleled Text Design with Top 5 Downloadable Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-execute-flawless-wirecast-broadcasts-on-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved How to Execute Flawless WireCast Broadcasts on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/3-ways-for-android-pokemon-go-spoofing-on-oppo-reno-11-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing On Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/green-screen-mastery-on-youtube-ideas-unleashed-for-2024/"><u>Green Screen Mastery on YouTube - Ideas Unleashed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/how-to-see-your-subscribers-on-youtube-in-2024/"><u>How to See Your Subscribers on YouTube, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-illuminating-success-brightening-up-your-youtube-videos/"><u>In 2024, Illuminating Success Brightening Up Your YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-obs-skype-screen-recording/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step OBS Skype Screen Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/leveraging-youtube-content-for-igtv-prominence-for-2024/"><u>Leveraging YouTube Content for IGTV Prominence for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/transformative-technology-unpacked-insightful-critique-on-asus-zenbook-flip-ux371e/"><u>Transformative Technology Unpacked: Insightful Critique on ASUS ZenBook Flip UX371E</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/weekly-tech-insights-exclusive-look-at-latest-windows-laptops-and-hidden-spotify-strategies/"><u>Weekly Tech Insights: Exclusive Look at Latest Windows Laptops & Hidden Spotify Strategies</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087395/7443" target="_top" id="2087395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087395/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

It’s a big world where new things happen every day, in every <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of the best ways to climb to the top of YouTube’s search engine results is to be among the first creators to make a video about a trending topic.</p><p>But how do you know what’s trending? If you’re in a huge genre like beauty or technology then it’s not impossible to keep track of the latest news and trends, but you probably hear about things as other people start making videos and as websites start publishing articles. How do you get on top of trends just as they’re becoming trends?</p><p>Google Trends, of course!</p><p>Google Trends is a completely free tool you can use to determine what’s trending on YouTube or in Google’s search engine. Here’s how you can use Google Trends to figure out what’s trending in your niche and make a video before there’s tons of competition.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture"><a href="#Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture"></a>Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-use-google-trends-to-come-up-with-video-seeing-big-picture.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Ideas"                ></p><p><em>You’ll need to be signed into your Google account to use Google Trends.</em></p><p>Start off at <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" >trends.google.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you’ll see what’s trending in general – usually big news stories or things like sports finals. The data is laid out like this: at the top there are three ‘Featured Insights’. These are three of the most popular trending topics paired with graphs of their recent search traffic. Underneath these there will be a list of stories that are currently trending. You can click on them to see charts of their search data and links to where the stories are being covered online.</p><p>Unless you do news or political commentary on your channel these probably aren’t topics you want to cover, but if you like to insert some topical references into your other videos then it’s still good to be aware of these things.</p><p>To get information more relevant to your channel you’re going to have to do some filtering.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You"><a href="#Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You"></a>Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You</h2><p>In the Google Trend home page, scroll down to the ‘Recently Trending’ section and click on ‘More Trending Searches’.</p><p>Then click from ‘Daily Search Trends’ to ‘Realtime Search Trends’.</p><p>On top you will see two drop-down menus, one is for the category and one is for location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-video-ideas.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Video Ideas"                ></p><p>Under <strong>All categories</strong> select the general theme your channel falls under.</p><p>Your options are business, entertainment, health, Sci&#x2F;Tech, sports, and top stories.</p><p>It might be the case that your channel doesn’t fall under any of these themes, but there could still be related stories for you in other categories. For example, if you have a beauty channel then there could be something that’d interest you under health, entertainment, or even business.</p><p>Under the <strong>location menu</strong> choose the region most of your viewers are from. This might not be the same as where you are from – you could be in Australia and most of your viewers could be in the U.S. If you’re not sure where your viewers are from you can find out in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics &gt; Demographics</strong>.</p><p>Once you have narrowed down your results you can just scroll through and pick out a topic related to your channel’s theme that you have something to say about.</p><p>For example, if you have a gaming channel and you’re looking for a non-gameplay topic to make a video on, you would look under Sci&#x2F;Tech. If I look under that category today (May 29, 2017) and specify that I want topics trending in the United States then these are my top 5 results:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-categories.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Category YouTube Video Ideas"                ></p><p>The first two happen to be about gaming. If you, as a gamer, had any strong reaction to either of these topics – whether it’s that you feel like you’re knowledgeable about them, or that you’re excited by something that’s coming up, or that something made you groan – then that would be a sign that you should make a video. Capitalizing on a trend while also covering a topic you have a lot to say about is always a good move.</p><p>Having something to say doesn’t have to mean having a strong opinion. If you just find something interesting and want to pass the information along to your viewers then that’s great too.</p><p>Clicking on these results will give you more specific data including how often the topic has been searched recently and links to recent news articles. These can give you a better idea of why it is trending and help you come up with what you want to say.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords"><a href="#Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Battle of the Keywords"></a>Part 3: Battle of the Keywords</h2><p>Once you have a topic in mind for your next video – whether it came from Google Trends or your own noggin – think about what the most important keyword for that topic might be.</p><p>A <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-12-step-youtube-seo-guide-for-beginners-who-want-more-448.html" >keyword is a word or short phrase <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that people type into a search engine like Google or YouTube. In order for people to find your videos, you’ll have to include a keyword in your video’s title.</p><p>Once you have a keyword in mind, type it into the Explore bar at the top of your page in Google Trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/explore-topic-in-google-trends.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Keywords YouTube Video"                ></p><p>What happens after you click <strong>enter</strong> is pretty much magic. Say I want to make a video on how to use Filmora. The first thing I’ll type into that Explore bar is ‘Filmora’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Keywords"                ></p><p>You can see near the top that this chart represents searches for the topic over the last 5 years, which isn’t necessarily useful (although it is sort of cool that you can see when Filmora was ‘born’). I’m going to narrow that down to results from the U.S in the last week.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-time-range.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Ideas Filmora"                ></p><p>There, now I can see how the popularity of Filmora as a search term has spiked on specific days and times (if you hover over a spike it tells you the time and day) and plan to post my video at a time that capitalizes on these trends.</p><p>Next, what other words do I want to include in my video title? Is this a review, a tutorial, or a how-to? By clicking on my search term Filmora, I can edit it to read ‘filmora review’. Then I can click <strong>+ Compare</strong> and type in ‘filmora tutorial’ and ‘how to use Filmora’. Google Trends will create a chart comparing the popularity of those 3 terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-comparison.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Filmora Keywords"                ></p><p><em>I also ‘zoomed out’ to 90 days – if I’d only looked at how they compared over the last week my results could have been skewed.</em></p><p>It’s pretty clear from the chart that ‘filmora review’ is the strongest of those 3 search terms. The title of my video should definitely start with the words <strong>Filmora Review</strong> because that is what most people are searching for when they want information about Filmora. Putting your most important keyword&#x2F;search term first in your video titles will help them rank better in the viewer’s search results.</p><p>Although, when you do a comparison like this you should also go to YouTube and search for each potential keyword&#x2F;phrase individually. It might turn out that there is a ton of strong competition for the most popular search term, and not as much for the second or third most popular. Here’s a search for ‘Filmora Review’ on YouTube:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-youtube-keyword-search.jpg"                      alt="YouTube search Filmora Keyword"                ></p><p><em>If my view of YouTube looks different from yours it’s because I’m using the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vidiq-vision-for-youtube/pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl?hl=en" >VidIQ plugin for Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free and it gives you all kinds of extra info about videos and channels.</em></p><p>The second-highest ranked result is only 2 months old and isn’t from a huge channel. Although there is competition for this keyword, ranking for it is not impossible. It also helps that software reviews are a topic where people will always be looking for the latest information&#x2F;newest videos.</p><p>If the search results for your keyword are dominated by monster channels with millions of subs, and you can’t think of an angle you can use to crack into those top results (i.e. having newer information people will be looking for, which the more established videos are lacking), then maybe try the search with your second best keyword and see if there’s a better opportunity for you to rank there.</p><p>One of the biggest benefits of identifying trends and making videos about them quickly is that you can get in before there’s a lot of competition for the first few pages of search results on YouTube or Google, and before larger channels start making videos of their own on the same topic.</p><p>Want to make coming up with YouTube video ideas a habit? <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-come-up-with-better-youtube-video-ideas-391.html" >This post here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will help you develop a process to generate more ideas and properly evaluate them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144309/7443" target="_top" id="2144309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144309/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Making-Better-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Making-Better-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Making Better YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Making Better YouTube Videos with Filmora</h2><p>As one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers, Filmora provides plentiful editing tools, such as cut, trim, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video stabilization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >noise removal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >chroma key compositing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and color grading.

Split revenue</h3><p>Although, YouTube clearly doesn’t mention the revenue you will generate from your YouTube channel under the YouTube partner agreement. Your channel and YouTube respectively share 55&#x2F;45 revenue. When you take help from your MCN the 55% earnings will further deteriorate after paying a percentage of your AdSense revenue to them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/revenue.JPG"                      alt="revenue"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151888/7443" target="_top" id="2151888">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151888" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151888/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Outcome-is-not-always-exciting-3"><a href="#2-Outcome-is-not-always-exciting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Outcome is not always exciting"></a>2. Outcome is not always exciting</h3><p>If you are thinking that the viewership will jump up multi-fold after involving a MCN, then you need to hold on and rethink. It is not guaranteed that a MCN will always end up giving you more view and subscribers to your channel, though it happens with some people.</p><p>Go through what you will be gaining from the YouTube MCN in terms of promoting your videos, promotional offers and increasing the subscriber as well as boosting your channel’s exposure.</p><p>Any MCN won’t guarantee you for achieving a specific number of subscribers or views if you join them. It’s important to work out what is important for us and for what reasons you are teaming up with that MCN.</p><p>In case there is no ROI for you with a YouTube MCN then it’s better to be on your own and try hard to enhance the reach and revenue. Without an ROI, it is futile to sacrifice your earnings in vain.</p><h2 id="The-bottom-line-3"><a href="#The-bottom-line-3" class="headerlink" title="The bottom line"></a>The bottom line</h2><p>If you are asking us that you should join a YouTube MCN, then we would recommend you that the decision lies with you. As a YouTube channel owner and content creator, you have a certain goal to achieve.</p><p>So, it’s you who needs to figure out the important steps to be taken for attaining all the short and long term goals. Weigh your options and then opt for MCNs, if their assistance and service are close to meeting your expectations with your YouTube channel.</p><p>To decide whether to go for a YouTube network partnership or not, first check what percentage of your revenue they will be charging. It’s a key constraint for deciding about the viability of the partnership. If after calculating the proposed revenue sharing you have substantial profits, then going with the MCN is worth it.</p><p>The next point is the term of the contract. Never go for contracts that stretch for a longer duration. Put more stress on the legal contracts with the help of a professional lawyer. You need to be very careful about rights, termination of contracts and the likes. Though, we won’t be elaborately explaining the legal decisions involved in officially joining any YouTube network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-securing-viewer-return-with-these-effective-strategies-for-higher-retention-rates/"><u>[New] Securing Viewer Return with These Effective Strategies for Higher Retention Rates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-keep-your-views-covert-with-these-tools/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Keep Your Views Covert with These Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-comprehensive-insights-into-polarrs-photo-tools/"><u>[Updated] Comprehensive Insights Into Polarr's Photo Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-iphoneipad-uploads-to-youtube-platforms/"><u>2024 Approved Navigating iPhone/iPad Uploads to YouTube Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-omniscope-networking-an-experts-guide-to-selecting-a-media-company/"><u>2024 Approved OmniScope Networking An Expert's Guide to Selecting a Media Company</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-secrets-to-profitability-earning-with-youtube-shorts-explored/"><u>2024 Approved Secrets to Profitability Earning with YouTube Shorts Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-strategies-to-dodge-content-advisory-strikes/"><u>2024 Approved Strategies to Dodge Content Advisory Strikes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-tiers-of-technology-youtube-gamers-showcase/"><u>2024 Approved Top Tiers of Technology YouTube Gamer's Showcase</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/complete-review-and-guide-to-techeligible-frp-bypass-and-more-for-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>Complete Review & Guide to Techeligible FRP Bypass and More For Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/enabling-the-nvenc-codec-with-handbrake-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Enabling the NVENC Codec with HandBrake - Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/how-to-render-and-upload-your-youtube-video-faster-in-2024/"><u>How to Render and Upload Your YouTube Video Faster, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-oppo-reno-10-proplus-5g-to-other-android-devices-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Contacts from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices Devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-vivo-s18e-phone-password-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Vivo S18e Phone Password Without Factory Reset?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-guide-to-catch-100-iv-pokemon-using-a-map-on-itel-a60s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Full Guide to Catch 100 IV Pokémon Using a Map On Itel A60s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/maximizing-impact-best-practices-for-corporate-screencast-training-for-2024/"><u>Maximizing Impact Best Practices for Corporate Screencast Training for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/quick-fixes-for-windows-11s-infamous-blue-screen-error/"><u>Quick Fixes for Windows 11'S Infamous Blue Screen Error</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

YouTube tags are vital as they help the YouTube algorithm fully understand the videos you post. It’s by this that those who are interested in your video get hooked to them.</p><p>For tags to work ideally, you need to include your brand-specific tags before adding similar tags. YouTube auto-suggest is another gem in this scenario. Just see what YouTube suggests when you type while searching other similar topics. For great results, place the most important keywords and tags first, as these will act as the face of your video.</p><h2 id="How-will-YouTube-tag-affect-your-video-performance"><a href="#How-will-YouTube-tag-affect-your-video-performance" class="headerlink" title="How will YouTube tag affect your video performance?"></a>How will YouTube tag affect your video performance?</h2><p>It is YouTube tags that help viewers to find videos they are searching for on YouTube.

Let’s take a look:</p><ol><li>Your account cannot have any copyright strikes and must be in good standing.</li><li>Your channel needs to be at least 30 days old.</li><li>You must have at least 1,000 subscribers.</li><li>You need to have received at least 100 views per day for the last 30 days.</li></ol><p>If you meet these requirements, and Fullscreen sounds like a good fit for you, go ahead and <a class="link"   href="http://fullscreenmedia.co/apply/" >apply for partnership <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The first thing that you need to do is go to the Fullscreen website and find the Channels page. Scroll to the lowest point and request more information. Click the button to trigger the appearance of a form and write a message to Fullscreen. Once you’ve sent your message, Fullscreen is going to take between 1 and 7 days to respond. If accepted, you will have to sign a contract and provide screenshots that confirm that your account is in good standing on the YouTube.</p><h3 id="How-Fullscreen-Pays-You"><a href="#How-Fullscreen-Pays-You" class="headerlink" title="How Fullscreen Pays You"></a>How Fullscreen Pays You</h3><p>You’ve entered into a partnership agreement – now you need to start getting paid. The process is simple.</p><p>Fullscreen will pay you through PayPal. They will calculate how much you’ve earned, and you will get that amount transferred to your account. Make sure to check the amount that you’ve earned from the dashboard of Fullscreen itself.</p><p>Becoming a Fullscreen partner might be a good idea for your channel if the perks appeal to you. However, think about your own skills and whether you are confident in your ability to keep on growing your channel yourself. Fullscreen provides you with a wide range of comprehensive marketing tools, but a lot of video creators are able to master YouTube marketing using the tools YouTube already provides. Before you agree to split profits with an MCN (in addition to the portion already claimed by YouTube), make sure you are really going to be earning more profits than you could alone.</p><h3 id="Bonus-Tip-Create-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Create-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip-Create Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Bonus Tip-Create Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> serves as an inevitable video editing software for video lovers.

If it doesn’t, you may need to upgrade your hardware to improve performance. The system requirements for Fallout 76 on PC are as follows:</p><h4 id="Minimum"><a href="#Minimum" class="headerlink" title="Minimum:"></a><strong>Minimum:</strong></h4><table><thead><tr><th>Operating system:</th><th>Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10 64-bit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Processor:</td><td>Intel Core i5-6600k 3.5 GHz&#x2F;AMD Ryzen 3 1300X 3.5 GHz or equivalent</td></tr><tr><td>Graphics:</td><td>NVIDIA GTX 780 3GB&#x2F;AMD Radeon R9 285 2GB or equivalent</td></tr><tr><td>Memory:</td><td>8 GB RAM</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Recommended"><a href="#Recommended" class="headerlink" title="Recommended:"></a><strong>Recommended:</strong></h4><table><thead><tr><th>Operating system:</th><th>Windows 7&#x2F;8.1&#x2F;10 64-bit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Processor:</td><td>Intel Core i7-4790 3.6 GHz &#x2F; AMD Ryzen 5 1500X 3.5 GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Graphics:</td><td>NVIDIA GTX 970 4GB &#x2F; AMD R9 290X 4GB</td></tr><tr><td>Memory:</td><td>8 GB RAM</td></tr></tbody></table><p> After confirming that your PC is good enough to run the game, continue to the following fixes.</p><h3 id="Fix-2-Disable-background-applications"><a href="#Fix-2-Disable-background-applications" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Disable background applications"></a>Fix 2: Disable background applications</h3><p> The applications running in the backgrounds can eat up your system resources, causing your device to have no sufficient RAM for your game. To free up more system resources and improve your game performance, you can disable all the unnecessary background applications before gaming.

All the uploads that the user has made before are added to the YouTube Video Editor. The tool allows the user to combine, trim, add music and customize. However, its functionality is limited to just that, and that’s why people are looking for the best YouTube Video Editor alternative.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complimentary editing suite. Check the best <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video editor alternatives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from this complete guide.</p><p>Some of the cons of the YouTube Video Editor are:</p><ul><li>It doesn’t have advanced editing features.</li><li>It requires Internet connection to use.</li><li>It is slow.</li><li>Users can only edit videos that were already uploaded to their YouTube account.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-5-YouTube-Video-Editor-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Best-5-YouTube-Video-Editor-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 YouTube Video Editor Alternatives"></a>Best 5 YouTube Video Editor Alternatives</h2><p>The good news is that there are good offline YouTube Video Editor Alternatives out there. Below are the top five:</p><h4 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.  Wondershare Filmora"></a>1.  Wondershare Filmora</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the most popular YouTube Video Editor alternatives. It is available for both Windows and Mac platforms. The best thing about Wondershare Filmora is that it is easy to use. And at the same time, it has more features than the YouTube Video Editor.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>Some of the key features of Filmora include:</p><ul><li>Allows the user to crop, cut, and combine video clips in just a few clicks</li><li>Supports the addition of multiple audio and video tracks</li><li>Choose from various overlays and filters</li><li>Supports face off, green screen, and PIP effects</li><li>Supports a wide range of video formats that include MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and WMV, just to name a few</li><li>Burn video to DVD, or instantly upload it to YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo</li></ul><h4 id="2-WeVideo"><a href="#2-WeVideo" class="headerlink" title="2.  WeVideo"></a>2.  WeVideo</h4><p>Another YouTube Video Editor alternative is <a class="link"   href="https://www.wevideo.com/" >WeVideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is a cloud-based video editor that allows the user to do the editing in any web browser. Just like the YouTube editing tool, the user must first upload the clips online in order to edit them, and create a video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bdayvideo-wevideo.jpg"                                     ></p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>One advantage of WeVideo is that it allows different users to collaborate in making a single video. A user can invite others to upload clips to the project, or even make different videos based on the same clips.</p><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>And because it is a cloud-based video editor, it requires an Internet connection in order to get the clips and do the editing. Not only that, the videos must be uploaded before they can be used. And there are cases in which a five-minute video will require hours of raw footages. Users with slow upload speeds will take hours before they can start editing. And users of the free version can only export 480p videos that have a watermark. Users need to pay for the full version.</p><h4 id="3-Loopster"><a href="#3-Loopster" class="headerlink" title="3. Loopster"></a>3. Loopster</h4><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.loopster.com/" >Loopster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a mobile app that can be a YouTube Video Editor alternative. It is available for both the Android and iOS platforms. The tool allows the user to rotate, splice and add sound effects, zoom, and crop videos directly from one’s smartphone. It comes with advanced features that include title screens, slow motion effect, and bubble text. The app also lets the user record video and sounds directly. After editing the video, the app can export it directly to Facebook or YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loopster.jpg"                                     ></p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>It does what it was designed to do when it is working. It is user-friendly and comes with a tutorial. It also works even if the smartphone is not connected to the internet. Editing is done offline. And best of all, it is free.</p><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>One the downside, it looks like the developer is no longer updating the app. Some users experience crashes and other bugs. There are also some users that stated that the slow motion effect didn’t work for them, which is why they can’t recommend it as a YouTube Video Editor alternative.</p><h4 id="4-Tubechop"><a href="#4-Tubechop" class="headerlink" title="4. Tubechop"></a>4. Tubechop</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tubechop.com/" >Tubechop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows the user to trim a video from any YouTube video and then share it. There are some videos that are just too long, and you want to cut it to the section that you find interesting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tubechop.jpg"                                     ></p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>Just like the other YouTube Video Editor alternatives, Tubechop is easy to use. The user just needs to enter the YouTube URL of the video, and then indicate the section that’s interesting, and that’s it.</p><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>However, Tubechop doesn’t allow users to download the resulting video. Tubechop only provides a link that allows users to view the chopped video. And when the original video is deleted, the chopped version will also be deleted.</p><h4 id="5-Viddyad"><a href="#5-Viddyad" class="headerlink" title="5. Viddyad"></a>5. Viddyad</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://viddyad.com/" >Viddyad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another cloud-based platform that lets users convert images, music, clips, and animated effects into a video. It is said to be the best way to create video ads for businesses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viddyad.jpg"                                     ></p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>There are several templates to choose from. Users can create video ads by adding videos, text, voiceover, special effects, music, and images. The platform also provides access to millions of image and video stock.</p><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>Viddyad is a YouTube Video Editor alternative for businesses that want to create video ads. It might not be the right video editor for individuals who just want to create and share their personal videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-canva-skills-purging-images-of-their-surroundings/"><u>[New] Canva Skills Purging Images of Their Surroundings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/n-2024-enthralling-epics-essential-channel-building-tactics/"><u>[New] In 2024, Enthralling Epics Essential Channel-Building Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-minimizing-moments-edit-longer-videos-for-youtube/"><u>[New] Minimizing Moments Edit Longer Videos for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-fix-missing-fb-watch-icon-quick-guide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Fix Missing FB Watch Icon - Quick Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-master-the-art-of-freezing-out-the-backdrop-in-your-design/"><u>[Updated] Master the Art of Freezing Out the Backdrop in Your Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-explore-and-learn-personalized-tiktok-identifier-creation/"><u>2024 Approved Explore and Learn Personalized TikTok Identifier Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-youtube-music-blends/"><u>2024 Approved Mastering YouTube Music Blends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-monthly-earnings-from-youtube-as-a-content-creator/"><u>2024 Approved Monthly Earnings From YouTube as a Content Creator</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tips-and-tricks-for-creating-engaging-collab-videos-on-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved Tips and Tricks for Creating Engaging Collab Videos on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/eradicating-error-x7007043c-in-windows-media-creator/"><u>Eradicating Error X.7007043C in Windows' Media Creator</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-change-lock-screen-wallpaper-on-realme-gt-5-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Change Lock Screen Wallpaper on Realme GT 5 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-for-2024/"><u>Latest YouTube Monetization Policy and Requirements for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/the-role-of-youtube-images-in-video-promotion-and-discovery/"><u>The Role of Youtube Images in Video Promotion and Discovery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/transforming-your-android-into-a-broadcast-hub/"><u>Transforming Your Android Into a Broadcast Hub</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934188/19272" target="_top" id="1934188">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934188" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934188/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

It not only allows you cut, trim, crop, zoom, reverse, rotate the video clips, but also makes the advanced features like green screen, PIP, tilt-shift and mosaic easy like a piece of cake. With Wondershare Filmora, you can ignite your YouTube videos with over 300 effects like Fashion, Beauty, Block Buster, Travel, etc.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><hr><p>The main difference between annotation and cards is their outlook. Cards are more graphical whereas annotations are text based. The cards slide in once you click the small “i” button on the video where as the annotation is there based on the timings set by the user. Moreover the main differences between the two are:</p><p>1. YouTube Cards are small and unobtrusive, unless a viewer chooses to click on them, which is why they are the better option when you are trying to get views on other videos. Irritating a few people with a big annotation might be worth it if you also draw other people’s attention to your cause or website, but it is not a good way to endear yourself to people you are trying to get views and subscriptions from. When a card is clicked a thumbnail will appear with a link to your additional content. YouTube Cards are often better than annotations for adding links to your videos because they look much tidier. Also, unlike annotations, cards will be visible to people watching your videos on their mobile devices.</p><p>2. You cannot use Cards just to insert notes into your videos, though, and you cannot adjust their size like you can with annotations. So, if you do need a link to be large and extremely noticeable, annotations might still be your best option. Cards and annotations can even be used in combination sometimes.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Add YouTube Cards</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Add YouTube Annotations</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-add-YouTube-Cards"><a href="#How-to-add-YouTube-Cards" class="headerlink" title="How to add YouTube Cards"></a>How to add YouTube Cards</h2><p>YouTube <strong>Cards</strong> are similar to annotations but more interactive. They allow the owner of the video to add images and other links.

Speech Bubbles"></a>1. Speech Bubbles</h4><p>Speech Bubbles: look like the dialogue box in a comic strip. There is a tail which you can adjust so it looks like one of the people in your video is saying what is written in the annotation. Speech bubbles are great for adding in funny comments.</p><h4 id="2-Notes"><a href="#2-Notes" class="headerlink" title="2. Notes"></a>2. Notes</h4><p>Notes: come in a limited selection of colors and can be adjusted to take up a maximum of 30% of your player screen. Sometimes you need a huge annotation to get an important point across, but using huge note annotations too often – especially near the beginnings of your videos – will annoy viewers. If you need a large note annotation make sure to place it later in your video, when a viewer will already be invested in what they are watching and less likely to click away.</p><h4 id="3-Titles"><a href="#3-Titles" class="headerlink" title="3. Titles"></a>3. Titles</h4><p>Titles: are large pieces of text that go either at the beginning of your video or in-between different topics within your video. YouTube’s titles are not very nice to look at, but they are a decent option if you do not have access to video editing software.</p><h4 id="4-Spotlights"><a href="#4-Spotlights" class="headerlink" title="4. Spotlights"></a>4. Spotlights</h4><p>Spotlights: have a subtle border and are completely clear inside. Your text only appears when a user hovers over the spotlight. Spotlights are great for turning elements within your video into links.</p><h4 id="5-Labels"><a href="#5-Labels" class="headerlink" title="5. Labels"></a>5. Labels</h4><p>Labels: are completely transparent, like spotlights, but the user does not have to hover over them for your text to be visible.</p><h4 id="6-Pauses"><a href="#6-Pauses" class="headerlink" title="6. Pauses"></a>6. Pauses</h4><p>Pauses: are no longer available to add to your videos, although Pause Annotations added before they were removed still work. Pause Annotations used to stop your video for a set period of time when your annotation appeared.</p><p>If somebody watches your video and gets to the end then that means they enjoyed it and will probably be open to checking out more of your content. Rather than hoping that your other videos show up in the ‘Suggested Videos’ YouTube will show after yours has finished playing you should always include an outro, or ending card, after your video to recommend your own work. Annotations are used in a lot of successful YouTuber’s ending cards.</p><p>One form this takes is small Note annotations in the bottom corners of the screen, one linking to your previous video and one to the next. Sometimes your viewers might not necessarily get the most enjoyment out of your videos by watching them in order, though. Sometimes you want to link viewers to the videos that are most related to the one they just watched.</p><p>The best outros also include a subscribe button, which can be created using annotations. These annotations work best when combined with a verbal call to action. Make sure your outro lasts long enough for people to make the decision to subscribe or click another video.</p><p>No matter what kind of annotations you are using, you should never use more than two of them at a time anywhere except for your outro. You should also never place annotations at the very top of your screen, or in the middle at the bottom. If your video is embedding on a separate website then the player will cover annotations at the top of the screen, and ads might cover annotations placed in the bottom-middle of the screen. Keep in mind when using annotations that they will not be visible to users watching your videos on mobile devices. If mobile traffic is very important to you then consider using YouTube Cards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-step-by-step-setting-up-your-smartphone-as-a-webcam-device/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step Setting Up Your Smartphone as a Webcam Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-fb-video-audio-extraction-made-simple-for-mp3-lovers-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] FB Video Audio Extraction Made Simple for MP3 Lovers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-learn-to-craft-eye-catching-youtube-thumbnails-using-your-phone/"><u>2024 Approved Learn to Craft Eye-Catching YouTube Thumbnails Using Your Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streaming-success-secrets-unveiling-monetization-on-dm-and-yo/"><u>2024 Approved Streaming Success Secrets Unveiling Monetization on Dm & Yo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/bargain-hunters-paradise-free-classified-offerings-at-oodle/"><u>Bargain Hunter's Paradise - Free Classified Offerings at Oodle</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/home-button-not-working-on-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-here-are-real-fixes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Home Button Not Working on ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra?
