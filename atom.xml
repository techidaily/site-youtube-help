You must look for the following things before choosing a game screen recorder.</p><ul><li>The option of personalizing the hotkeys</li><li>Number of built-in tools</li><li>How to begin and pause recording</li><li>Number of codes offered by it</li><li>Recording time</li><li>Editing features like cut and paste</li><li>Custom-made Recording Resolution</li><li>Adjustable video frames</li></ul><p>In addition to this, some game recorders also affect your in-game fps (Frame per second). You should also check whether it is compatible with large-sized files or not. The quality of the video also depends upon the file size. The larger is file size, the higher is video quality. However, you can face problems while uploading huge-sized videos as online content distributors hardly support such files. So you must compress your video before sharing anywhere. There are also some recorders that provide a direct link to social networking sites. Thus you should consider these factors also before purchasing the game recording software.</p><p>You can easily run this recorder on your computer if it is updated and has 8GB of RAM. PC should also have two storage drives so as to install gaming software on one drive and record videos on another drive. It is also advisable to use computers than laptops for recording screen activities because laptops rarely have two storage drives.</p><p>You can easily run this recorder on your computer if it is updated and has 8GB of RAM.

What software do YouTubers use to record gameplay?</h3><p>Most gamers on YouTube use Open Broadcast System (OBS) and Bandicam to record their gameplays. However, there are a few more authentic screen recording tools for high-quality video recording, such as Filmora.</p><p>Using Filmora to record your gameplay will help you save the video in all major video formats. Moreover, the tool is also compatible with Mac and Windows operating systems.</p><h3 id="Q2-How-do-I-record-my-screen-smoothly"><a href="#Q2-How-do-I-record-my-screen-smoothly" class="headerlink" title="Q2. How do I record my screen smoothly?"></a>Q2. How do I record my screen smoothly?</h3><p>You should do a couple of things to avoid lagging while screen recording your gameplay. For example, do not use your built-in microphone to record your voice during screen recording. Instead, use an external microphone.</p><p>Only record what is important. Use high RAM and have a good graphics card. And most importantly, get screen recorders with at least 60fps.</p><h3 id="Q3-Does-screen-recording-decrease-FPS"><a href="#Q3-Does-screen-recording-decrease-FPS" class="headerlink" title="Q3. Does screen recording decrease FPS?"></a>Q3. Does screen recording decrease FPS?</h3><p>Yes, it does affect your overall gaming performance. However, it depends on several factors. For instance, the fps won’t be affected much if you’re playing a less CPU-intensive game. The only way to sustain FPS is to have a high-quality screen recorder, such as OBS, Filmora, Bandicam, and Fraps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-finding-opportunities-where-youtube-collaborations-thrive/"><u>[New] Finding Opportunities  Where YouTube Collaborations Thrive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-foremost-guide-to-youtube-equipment-for-rookies/"><u>[New] Foremost Guide to YouTube Equipment for Rookies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/how-to-vlog-confidently-like-popular-youtubers-for-2024/"><u>How to Vlog Confidently Like Popular YouTubers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-recruiter-shorts-find-your-motivation/"><u>2024 Approved  Top Recruiter Shorts  Find Your Motivation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/infographics-leveraging-social-media-videos-for-2024/"><u>Infographics  Leveraging Social Media Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-maximize-content-impact-with-youtubes-movie-maker-tools/"><u>In 2024, Maximize Content Impact with YouTube's Movie Maker Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-nextgen-videostreaming-platforms/"><u>2024 Approved  Exploring NextGen Videostreaming Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-examining-the-potential-of-4-second-subscriptions/"><u>In 2024, Examining the Potential of 4-Second Subscriptions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-jump-cuts-in-fcpx-best-practices/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Jump Cuts in FCPX Best Practices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgot-pattern-lock-heres-how-you-can-unlock-samsung-galaxy-s24plus-pattern-lock-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Forgot Pattern Lock?

The key is to find one where you won’t be reduced to a database entry listing your channel’s genre and your subscriber count.</p><p>If you want to be valued for your talent then FameBit is a great choice, but it’s not your only choice. If you are serious about finding sponsorships and creating branded content then there is no reason you shouldn’t be on multiple platforms.</p><ol><li><strong><a href="#revfluence">Revfluence</a></strong></li><li><a href="#tapin"><strong>TapInfluence</strong></a></li><li><a href="#izea"><strong>Izea</strong></a></li><li><a href="#readypulse"><strong>ReadyPulse</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="4-Alternatives-to-FameBit"><a href="#4-Alternatives-to-FameBit" class="headerlink" title="4 Alternatives to FameBit"></a>4 Alternatives to FameBit</h2><p>Here are four influencer marketing platforms besides FameBit that cater to creators, not just brands.</p><h4 id="Revfluence"><a href="#Revfluence" class="headerlink" title="Revfluence"></a><strong>Revfluence</strong></h4><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.revfluence.com/" >Revfluence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> promises creators they will be able to ‘create content on their terms’. They work with both YouTubers and Instagrammers.</p><p>A lot of big fashion brands like Calvin Klein, Madewell, and Gap can be found on Revfluence. This platform is a must if you have a lifestyle, beauty, or fashion channel.</p><p>On Revfluence you can browse through brands instead of waiting for them to contact you. You choose which companies you want to endorse, so you never have to worry about losing your integrity in the eyes of your subscribers. Once you find a sponsor, you maintain control over how you choose to collaborate with them.</p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-tapinfluence.jpg"                      alt="Alternatives to FameBit - Tapinfluence"                ></strong></p><h4 id="TapInfluence"><a href="#TapInfluence" class="headerlink" title="TapInfluence"></a><strong>TapInfluence</strong></h4><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.tapinfluence.com/" >TapInfluence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might initially seem more brand-focused than equal, like FameBit, because it makes you wait for brands to select you. You are not simply on-call for any brand willing to pay, though.</p><p>After a brand approaches you, you get to examine their offer and decide whether you would feel proud to be associated with them.</p><p>The main thing that sets TapInfluence apart from other platforms where brands approach you is their attitude towards influencers and the way they define influence.</p><p>Some creators get turned off by the word ‘influencer’, and it is easy to understand why. Your subscriber count is important when you want to participate in an ad campaign, but your subscribers are not just numbers and you are not some kind of puppetmaster ‘influencing’ them for monetary gain.</p><p>TapInfluence values authenticity and works with brands that hold that same value. Your ability to be genuine with your audience is never compromised because it is that honest relationship that makes you valuable to brands.</p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-izea.jpg"                      alt="Alternatives to FameBit - Izea"                ></strong></p><h4 id="Izea"><a href="#Izea" class="headerlink" title="Izea"></a><strong>Izea</strong></h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://izea.com/" >Izea’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> motto states that they champion the creators. They value you for whatever it is you already do, be it ranting vlogs or educational content.</p><p>When you create your profile on Izea you connect your YouTube account, and any other social media account you open to use for branded content. You also describe your audience and state your asking price.</p><p>Brands distribute their sponsorship opportunities to select groups of creators based on what they are looking for. Sponsors may approach you, or you can take matters into your own hands and approach brands with creative pitches.</p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-readypulse.jpg"                      alt="Alternatives to FameBit - ReadyPulse"                ></strong></p><h4 id="ReadyPulse"><a href="#ReadyPulse" class="headerlink" title="ReadyPulse"></a><strong>ReadyPulse</strong></h4><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.readypulse.com/" >ReadyPulse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is different from both FameBit and the other platforms on this list because you do not join brands for specific campaigns, you become a brand ambassador.</p><p>The idea is that you continue being you – creating the same style of content you already do – but you also have a relationship with a brand that you openly support and advocate for. The trust your subscribers have in you is supposed to be extended to your associated brands.</p><p>This is excellent if you have the opportunity to become a brand ambassador for a company you respect and are excited to work with. You can get all kinds of perks – like discounts and early releases – from your partner brand, and there is no reason you should not want your subscribers to trust the brand that you trust.</p><p>It becomes problematic if you find yourself matched with brands you do not have total confidence in, although ReadyPulse does try to match brands with influencers who are already fans of them.</p><p>Only you can decide if becoming a brand ambassador is right for you and your audience.</p><p> Do you know about any other sites like Famebit?</p><p>If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>, which will definitely enhance your productivity and helps you to make money by making videos much easier.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Ultimate-Guide-to-YouTube-Caption-Insertion"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Guide-to-YouTube-Caption-Insertion" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Guide to YouTube Caption Insertion"></a>The Ultimate Guide to YouTube Caption Insertion</h2><h1 id="How-To-Add-Captions-to-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#How-To-Add-Captions-to-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How To Add Captions to YouTube Videos"></a>How To Add Captions to YouTube Videos</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett"><a href="#Richard-Bennett" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>By captioning your YouTube videos you help to make them accessible to more potential viewers. Subtitles are useful to viewers who have hearing impairments, whose first language is different from yours, or who are unable to watch your video with sound. Closed captioning can also be useful for you as a YouTuber because it helps with your SEO, or search engine optimization. Practicing better SEO can get your videos ranked higher in search results. Google and YouTube both index subtitles and transcripts much like they do your video’s description, unless you use automated captions.</p><p>This article will first explain how you can turn on subtitles for the videos you watch and then walk you through adding captions to your own videos.</p><h2 id="How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How To Turn On Captions on YouTube"></a>How To Turn On Captions on YouTube</h2><p>In order for you to be able to view subtitles for a YouTube video the uploader of the video will need to have added them, unless you change your account settings to display automatic captions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/captions-how-to-turn-on.JPG"                      alt="captions"                ></p><p>To toggle subtitles on and off click on the Closed Captioning icon in the bottom right of your video player.</p><p>If the creator of the video has not added captions then you can enable automatic captions by going into your <strong>Account Settings</strong> and selecting <strong>Playback</strong>. Check the box next to <strong>Always Show Captions</strong>, and then check   <strong>Show Automatic Captions by Speech Recognition</strong>. These captions may be flawed, but you will still be able to see the more accurate user submitted captions on videos that have them. The <strong>Always Show Captions</strong> feature may be useful not only to the hearing impaired, but to users who do not speak the same language as the video producer.</p><p>If you want to change the language of the subtitles click on the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear) next to the closed captioning icon and choose your language next to   <strong>Subtitles&#x2F;CC</strong> . If the language you want is not there select <strong>Auto-Translate</strong>  and then pick a language. Google Translate will be used to generate subtitles in your chosen language.</p><h2 id="Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps"><a href="#Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps"></a>Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to <strong>Video Manager</strong> in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> and then look at your videos. Decide which one you want to add captions to.</p><p>2. Click on the drop-down menu next to the video you want to add captions to and choose <strong>Subtitles and CC</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Add New</strong> <strong>Subtitles or CC</strong>.</p><p>4. Choose whether to create your captions, upload a file that has them, transcribe your video, use automatic captioning, or use captioning software.</p><p><strong>Create Subtitles or Closed Captions</strong> will allow you to create your subtitles on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Upload A File</strong> allows you to upload a pre-made subtitle file from your computer. Supported file types include SubRip (.srt) and SubViewer (.sbv). You cannot use a word or PDF document for your subtitles.</p><p><strong>Transcribe and Set Timings</strong> is where you can type a transcript of your video and set timings to sync it to your video. This differs from Create Subtitles or Closed Captions in that your transcript is all typed in to one text field.</p><p><strong>Use Automatic Captioning</strong> will automatically use speech recognition technology to create captions. You can edit these auto-generated captions later if there are mistakes.</p><p><strong>Use Captioning Software or Services</strong> is what you choose if you want to use a program or service to create the subtitles for your video.</p><p>The easiest way to add subtitles to your videos is to use <strong>Automatic Captioning</strong>. However, Automatic Captioning is imperfect and may result in your viewers getting a sloppy, skewed, interpretation of your video. Automatic captions are also not indexed by YouTube and Google the way subtitles you create or upload are. This means that they will not have any value to your SEO strategy. If you do not input your own captions or transcript you are missing out on an opportunity for better search engine rankings. Automatic Captions are great if you do not have time to input subtitles and need a temporary solution, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/key-screen-snapping-programs-for-content-sharing-for-2024/"><u>Key Screen-Snapping Programs for Content Sharing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-simplified-customization-for-your-youtube-channel-url/"><u>[New] Simplified Customization for Your YouTube Channel URL</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-the-finest-video-platforms-other-than-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved  Exploring the Finest Video Platforms Other Than Youtube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-guide-to-iconic-youtube-beginnings-method-a-and-b/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step Guide to Iconic YouTube Beginnings  Method A & B</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-prodigious-platform-professionals/"><u>In 2024, Prodigious Platform Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-peaking-at-number-one-on-youtube-what-to-know/"><u>[New] Peaking at Number One on YouTube  What to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-proven-10-yoga-instructors-to-elevate-your-health/"><u>2024 Approved  Proven 10 Yoga Instructors to Elevate Your Health</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-understanding-recent-youtube-financial-policies/"><u>2024 Approved  Understanding Recent YouTube Financial Policies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/in-2024-apex-mp3-harmonizer-elevate-your-macs-music-playback/"><u>In 2024, Apex MP3 Harmonizer Elevate Your Macs Music Playback</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/new-mobile-magic-top-free-video-effects-apps-to-elevate-your-videos-for-2024/"><u>New Mobile Magic Top Free Video Effects Apps to Elevate Your Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/complete-guide-to-adding-texts-to-tiktok/"><u>Complete Guide to Adding Texts to TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/elite-facebook-file-fetcher-for-firefox-users-for-2024/"><u>Elite Facebook File Fetcher For Firefox Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/facebooks-guide-to-enhancing-past-recordings-for-live-streaming/"><u>Facebook's Guide to Enhancing Past Recordings for Live Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-and-where-to-find-a-shiny-stone-pokemon-for-lava-yuva-2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How and Where to Find a Shiny Stone Pokémon For Lava Yuva 2? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-art-and-science-of-auditory-retrogression-best-audio-reverser-tools/"><u>Updated In 2024, The Art and Science of Auditory Retrogression Best Audio Reverser Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/curator-of-tweets-premium-compilation-toolkit/"><u>Curator of Tweets - Premium Compilation Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-unmatched-recording-alternatives-for-modern-gaming-enthusiasts-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unmatched Recording Alternatives for Modern Gaming Enthusiasts for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

There’s nothing to get nervous about when you have expert tips on how to shoot a perfect makeup tutorial:</p><ol><li>Make sure you sit facing a window from where the sun is shining through so that it provides a soft natural glow to your face.</li><li>Ensure there’s a continuous stream of light, which hardly flickers or distorts. Set up a ring light to mimic the natural light.</li><li>To justify the colors of your work and make them pop on your skin, surround yourself with LED luminosity attached with reflectors to disperse the rays evenly throughout the room. This shall keep away the shadows from swallowing you.</li><li>Assure quality audio by upgrading to camera mics or simply switch to a reliable audio software for getting the work done.</li><li>Edit out the awkward moments from the shoot, add interesting transitions and effects by narrowing down to a reliable video editing software. Filmora can be a wonderful tool to fine-tune your video, add endless effects, remove background noise (if any) and provide you with full 4K support. And the best thing about it is that it’s free for beginners!</li></ol><h3 id="Custom-Your-Makeup-Videos-with-Excellent-Video-Editing-Tool"><a href="#Custom-Your-Makeup-Videos-with-Excellent-Video-Editing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Custom Your Makeup Videos with Excellent Video Editing Tool"></a>Custom Your Makeup Videos with Excellent Video Editing Tool</h3><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="Wrapping-Up"><a href="#Wrapping-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h3><p>All you have to do is subscribe to the channels of all the compiled YouTube makeup artists for real-time updates.

In our guide, you will find an answer to this, along with related queries like how YouTube highlighted comment works, the removal process, its benefits, and more.</p><p>If you own a YouTube channel or are starting one, even you can do this. Without further ado, let’s jump straight into the core of YouTube’s highlighted comments. We’ve categorized this article into a total of 8 parts for simple and better understanding.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Does Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Does Highlighted Comments Look Like on YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Make Comment Highlighted?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Highlighted Comments URL?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment</a></li><li><a href="#part8">Part 8: Benefits of Highlighted Comments</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?"></a>Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</h2><p>Before you get on with highlighting your comments, you must understand what it means exactly. You may follow comments on the videos posted by several YouTubers, but the highlighted ones are always making it to the top of the list.</p><p>Having said that, neither the content creator nor users or moderators choose to highlight YouTube comments to begin with. They are no rocket science, but only a tad bit more than what you know as a bookmarking feature.</p><p>Think of highlighted comments as a “tag”. You might notice this in the form of a ‘new activity YouTube notification’ link you receive on your registered email. Only you can see this tag when you click the notification and arrive at Youtube.com to either view or reply to a comment.</p><p>Highlighting comments (HC’s) are an automatic feature generated by YouTube. It draws the YouTuber’s &amp; viewer’s attention to relevant activities. Don’t fail to notice that the highlight disappears once you are done interacting in the tagged comment thread. However, they are reloadable by tapping the comment timestamp.</p><p>For instance, you may want to check the following links. The 2 URLs lead you to the same video, but only one of them shows a highlighted comment.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>Notice the name “lc” in the first URL- that stands for linked comment. YouTube might include this additional parameter. If a reply comment (HR) gets highlighted, the parent comment gets raised to the top.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?"></a>Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?</h2><p>YouTube has been working on improving the navigation of the comment section for videos, and highlighted comments are one of them. These comments appear even above the pinned comments on a video. The label of a highlighted comment is displayed above the commentator’s name in a light grey shade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>YouTube labels comment replies as well and call it “Highlighted Reply.” You can see this tag above the replier’s name in the same color tone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-reply.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Reply"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?"></a>Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?</h2><p>Now, making YouTube highlight your comment on a popular video is nothing less than an art. YouTube doesn’t make it easy for you. The advantage of getting your comment highlighted on YouTube is limitless.</p><p>Thus, anybody who wants to get their YouTube comment an HC tag has to follow a few simple steps, which we will discuss below in another section. Finding the correct or relevant video content that can benefit your channel from such a comment is an excellent place to start.</p><p>For example, if you are a YouTuber who deals in tech information, you need to look for a popular video or channel with a similar genre, in this case, technical knowledge. The more popular the channel is, the more is the chance of a viewer checking the comments on its videos. You will only benefit if you’re comment is highlighted on pages of Youtuber’s who are huge.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>The ways to acquire the URL or link for a highlighted comment are different for both parties- viewer and host.</p><p>Suppose you are a viewer who is going through the comments section of a video. If you want to get the highlighted URL for the comment, simply click on the timestamp (e.g., 2 weeks ago) beside the commentator’s username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>On the other hand, for a YouTuber, getting access to the comment URL is relatively straightforward. The host will get a notification on his or her registered email-id when a viewer publishes a comment on their posted video. You will find the link to the highlighted comment in the notification</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Reply-to-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Reply-to-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Replying to “highlighted comments” on your YouTube channel is pretty easy since this feature was developed, keeping the user’s convenience in mind. If you want to follow up or reply to such comments, you can do so from your email or YouTube Dashboard.</p><p>If you click the notification bell icon, whenever a viewer drops a new comment on one of your videos, YouTube will send you a notification via email. On opening the email, you will find a clickable “Reply” option. Or else, if you follow the comment section in the YouTube Dashboard, you can directly view or reply to highlighted comments from here as well.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why a highlighted comment always shows at the top of the comment list? Both the above options will lead you to the comment thread on YouTube. To help you find the new activity easily, it appears with the highlight tag on it. The purpose is to remind you that you are here for that specific comment.</p><h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Can you, as a video maker, remove highlighted comments on YouTube? The direct answer to this would be a ‘No.’ It is because based on how you have opened the specific video, YouTube does it automatically.</p><p>Alternatively, you can try out a few temporary solutions.</p><ol><li>You can edit the particular URL of the video where the highlighted tag is showing. Remove the red part of the URL (example given below) starting with “&amp;”:</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> After removing the above parameter, reload the original video link (below):</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ol><li>Try logging out from your Google Account and browse YouTube (anonymously). Doing this will ensure that you no longer see any highlighted comments. However, at the same time, this will restrict you from interacting in any way with that video, let alone leaving a comment.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-7-Tips-for-Writing-a-Comment-that-will-be-Pinned-as-a-Highlighted-Comment"><a href="#Part-7-Tips-for-Writing-a-Comment-that-will-be-Pinned-as-a-Highlighted-Comment" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment that will be Pinned as a Highlighted Comment?"></a>Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment that will be Pinned as a Highlighted Comment?</h2><p>Many frequently inquire on the internet about how they can improve the chances of getting their comment pinned, as highlighted on YouTube. The secret lies in how you write the statement. We’ve listed a few pro tips below that can help:</p><ul><li>First, go through all the posted comments under the video. It will help you identify what is missing. You can comment or write the missing point in comprehendible and straightforward words. Also, never forget to acknowledge the YouTuber’s talent.</li><li>Remember, no one has the time to read long comments. So, when you know what you want to write, try to shorten your sentences. A short and crisp comment draws more attention.</li><li>After you have framed your comment, make sure that it is grammatically correct. YouTube and Google hate grammatical errors.</li><li>Do not hit the post option already. Before publishing it, you must cross-check that your comment has all the above points in place.</li><li>Lastly, you have to wait after publishing on the video’s comment section. YouTube will highlight your comment if it passes according to the YouTube policy and if the search engine finds it unique.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial"><a href="#Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?"></a>Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?</h2><p>Being a convenience feature, a highlighted comment on YouTube is 100% beneficial. That is especially true if you are looking for ways to optimize your channel.</p><p>YouTube is undeniably the second largest search engine on the web. Highlight comments can potentially increase the outreach of your content and, consequently, your brand presence.</p><p>As said earlier, these comments always show first on the comment section. Needless to say, many people who watch the videos also scroll down to the comments section to start a conversation or see what other viewers are saying about this video.</p><p>In the process, alongside the interaction, they also check out the channels or profiles of the commentators. Viewers often visit the pages of these channels, and if they happen to enjoy the video content, they will subscribe to the YouTuber’s channel. If your comment gets highlighted, your YouTube channel can be one of them.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>YouTube can be an intimidating tool for marketing and more so for newcomers. Every YouTuber wishes that their channel performs better than the previous day. Even though the highlighted comment or highlighted reply feature doesn’t have any direct benefits, it can indeed help in optimizing your YouTube channel.</p><p>It can connect you with potential viewers and increase the number of people that visit your channel regularly. However, how many of them stay and hit the “Subscribe” button is a different story altogether and is wholly based on whether they like what you share through your videos.</p><p>In this article, we have shared facts on YouTube’s commonly seen highlighted comment feature. Yet, the term is a heavily misleading one, as far as viewers and Youtuber’s are concerned. We have also covered all other aspects and queries related to this term. Here’s hoping they clarify all your doubts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-key-to-youtube-success-understanding-your-cpm/"><u>2024 Approved  The Key to YouTube Success  Understanding Your CPM</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-melodic-mastery-top-15-educational-musician-oriented-vids-on-the-web/"><u>2024 Approved  Melodic Mastery  Top 15 Educational Musician-Oriented Vids on the Web</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-self-balancing-snap-shots-without-supports/"><u>In 2024, Self-Balancing  Snap Shots Without Supports</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-quicksilver-chords-shorts-actor-melodies/"><u>In 2024, Quicksilver Chords  Shorts' Actor Melodies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-imageslice-editor/"><u>In 2024, ImageSlice Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-optimize-your-channels-with-youtubes-featured-spotlight/"><u>In 2024, How to Optimize Your Channels with YouTube’s Featured Spotlight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-the-secrets-of-profitability-in-youtube-shorts/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlocking the Secrets of Profitability in YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-wirecast-for-high-quality-youtube-broadcasts/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigating WireCast for High-Quality YouTube Broadcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-identifying-and-tapping-into-youtubes-hidden-niches/"><u>[New] Identifying and Tapping Into Youtube's Hidden Niches</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/best-free-webm-players/"><u>Best Free WebM Players</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unveiling-the-differences-between-ig-reels-vs-stories/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unveiling the Differences Between IG Reels Vs Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-6-plus-without-passcode-or-face-id-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus without Passcode or Face ID</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-next-level-in-monitor-technology-a-deep-dive-into-p2715qs-wonders/"><u>2024 Approved  The Next Level in Monitor Technology - A Deep Dive Into P2715Q's Wonders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-soundcloud-downloads-tips-and-techniques/"><u>2024 Approved Mastering Soundcloud Downloads Tips and Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-broadcast-software-beyond-standard-obs/"><u>2024 Approved  Broadcast Software Beyond Standard OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-youtube-edition-expert-advice-on-creating-compelling-video-edits/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Youtube Edition  Expert Advice on Creating Compelling Video Edits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/stitch-storytelling-creating-content-that-closes-the-gap-for-2024/"><u>Stitch Storytelling  Creating Content that Closes the Gap for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-tips-to-add-audio-to-video-in-premiere-pro/"><u>Updated Tips to Add Audio to Video in Premiere Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/smartphone-streaming-success-without-a-massive-subscriber-base/"><u>Smartphone Streaming Success Without a Massive Subscriber Base</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

It’s all about flexing your creativity muscle and we are here to help you do it. Are you ready to be inspired? Great! Let’s begin this list:</p><h2 id="2-Showcase-Who-You-Are"><a href="#2-Showcase-Who-You-Are" class="headerlink" title="2. Showcase Who You Are"></a><strong>2. Showcase Who You Are</strong></h2><p><strong>Talk About Yourself:</strong> Introduce yourself to the world. You can answer 10 of the most common ice breaker questions you get at social gatherings: “Who are you?” “What do you do for a living?” “What are your hobbies?” In this video, you get to decide how you want to showcase yourself to your audience.</p><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do you have opinions? Of course, you do. Movie trailers, popular YouTube videos, products such as makeup, gadgets, and toys, you have thoughts on everything. It’s more than content creation, it’s critical thinking. Understanding why you like or dislike something is not only helpful for other people like you, but it’s also helpful for you to know your own preferences. It’s a little exercise in self-discovery.</p><p><strong>Day in a Life:</strong> Bring the audience with you on a day of your life. Show people what it is like to walk in your shoes from morning to night. How do you commute to school or work? What do you have for lunch? What obstacles do you encounter throughout the day? You’ll be surprised what will happen as your day unfolds.</p><p><strong>Top 10:</strong> People love lists because it’s a simple rundown. When you set your video as a list, the viewer knows exactly what they are getting, and familiarity with the format will make it more likely to be clicked. While you can make a top 12 or top 16 list, it is shown that picking <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3024538/why-we-love-top-10-lists" >a number ending on “0” will yield the best results <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Routines:</strong> What do you do when you get ready for school or work? What do you do before bed? Discussing your routine can inspire people to lead the life you have. <a class="link"   href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2015/10/the-psychology-of-daily-routine-7-reasons-why-people-who-do-the-same-things-each-day-tend-to-be-happier-than-those-who-chase-adventure/" >A routine does not mean going to an office every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it can mean eating a new restaurant every month, doing something impulsive once a week, or appreciating what you have on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> You’ve come a long way and you don’t always acknowledge it. Were there a few pivotal milestones in the last five years? Were there new friends you made or new places you’ve been to? Can’t think of anything? Well, pull out your calendar and flip back a few months and a few years. Was there something you scheduled that you’ve forgotten? It was important enough for you to mark it down at the time, reflect on how it went, and what you got out of it.</p><p> <strong>Favorites: Game, food, or sports team: when you talk about your favorite things, you allow people to take a peek into the history of you. It’s easier to get people excited when you talk about something you are passionate about, so do it! Also, talking about your favorite thing allow other people who like those things to find you. This is a great way to find and build your own community</strong></p><p><strong>Relatonships:</strong> Your parents, your partner, your teachers, or your friends, your relationship with each of those people are different, even though you are the same person. That’s the beauty of a relationship. This makes it a great topic to share on YouTube because it shows a unique side of who you are every time you speak about another relationship you have.</p><p> <strong>Rant:</strong> The world is out to get you… not really, but there are enough annoying situations during the week to fill a weekly rant segment for your channel. Here’s a tip about ranting that you should use to avoid sounding whiny: offer a solution at the end or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uEDTM2g3WQ%20" >be funny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong> Like the elementary school exercise, show and tell is a terrific way to show off something interesting you have and talk about the significance of it. An old childhood toy, a new gadget, a gift from a friend: every item has a story, show and tell it.</p><h2 id="3-Challenge-Yourself"><a href="#3-Challenge-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenge Yourself"></a><strong>3. Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone:</strong> Do something that you didn’t think you can do and film it. It might end up being a <a href="#Fail">Fail</a>, but that is how you learn. Learn a new language and talk to a native speaker. Go bungee jumping. Offer free hugs in public. Do something that makes your heart beat faster everyday and film it.</p><p><strong>Live On A Budget:</strong> Reduce your weekly budget to $50, can you do it? How about $10? This YouTube video idea gives you perspective into your life. How will your lifestyle change when you vastly reduce your expenses? Knowing this can actually help us prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p><p> <strong>30 Day Challenge:</strong> Usually a 30-day challenge is associated with partaking in a healthy activity such as exercise or giving up a bad habit. But all that has been done, why not challenge yourself to do something different? Cook all your meals for 30 days. Take a different route to work every day for 30 days. Have a 10-minute long conversation with someone new for 30 days.</p><p><strong>Speed Round:</strong> You think you are good at something? Well, why not try to do it as quickly as possible? Complete a round of video games as quickly as you can. Do a MasterChef mystery box challenge in your kitchen. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E" >Run from one subway station to the next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, beating the tube itself.</p><h2 id="4-Show-Your-Talent"><a href="#4-Show-Your-Talent" class="headerlink" title="4. Show Your Talent"></a><strong>4. Show Your Talent</strong></h2><p><strong>Make Music:</strong> An original song, a cover, or a remix, YouTube is a fantastic platform to showcase your musical talents. Don’t forget, some of the world’s top artists began their journey on YouTube. You might be next to join the <a class="link"   href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube" >discovered on YouTube list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Creating:</strong> Are you an artist? Show your process in making a piece. Depending on the speed in which your project takes, use a timelapse to present what you did in the most effective way.</p><p> <strong>Unusual skill:</strong> Do you have a party trick that you would love to show everyone, but don’t have a party to go to? YouTube is the place for you. Juggle, do a magic trick, dance like Christopher Walkens, whatever unusual skill you have, share it on camera, and get the accolades you so deserve.</p><h2 id="5-Explore-Your-Surroundings"><a href="#5-Explore-Your-Surroundings" class="headerlink" title="5. Explore Your Surroundings"></a><strong>5. Explore Your Surroundings</strong></h2><p><strong>Tour:</strong> Your home, your office, your city. Bring your camera and take your audience on a tour of a place you know well. Show them all the hidden gems, tell them a story about the history, and be spontaneous and discover along the way.</p><p> <strong>Special Event:</strong> In any community, there is always a special event taking place, whether it be a concert, a festival, or a conference. Film the environment, interview attendees, and share the experience.</p><p><strong>Travel:</strong> Go on a trip and bring your camera with you. Create drama by documenting all the things that didn’t go as planned… and any memorable trip will have hiccups along the way. Discover things along the way and vocalize your thoughts through the trip.</p><p><strong>Discuss Current Events:</strong> As the environmental climate, there is also a social and political climate. Address the current state of events in your city. Are there plans to build new infrastructure? Is there a social injustice that the public should know about? You can discuss international affairs, national politics, or keep it local to start.</p><h2 id="6-Be-An-Educator"><a href="#6-Be-An-Educator" class="headerlink" title="6. Be An Educator"></a><strong>6. Be An Educator</strong></h2><p><strong>Advice:</strong> Have you been through a trying experience? Do you have advice for other people setting off on the same path? Whether it’s graduating school, starting a new job, losing weight, or practicing a new skill, creating content that offers helpful advice for those seeking it will give you credibility to speak about the topic since you have gone through the situation yourself.</p><p><strong>How to Plan Something:</strong> Did you plan a camping trip that went really well? Did you throw a surprise birthday party that went without a hitch? It doesn’t have to be anything grand but think back to something you followed successfully and explain what you did to achieve it.</p><p> <strong>Lifehacks:</strong> Do you have lifehacks? This may be the most generous gift you can share with your audience. You can save them time, energy, and a whole lot of headaches. If you have an engineering spirit, then consider how you can simplify all the little activities that make up a day. No engineering spirit? Start with these <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/100-life-hacks-that-make-life-easier.html" >lifehacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>instead.</p><p><strong>Time Management:</strong> The responsibility of every person is slightly different, but how you manage your daily schedule. Do you write tasks down on an agenda? Do you have a calendar? What do you do when you get distracted? What is your schedule like? Do you create your own bullet journal or use a productivity app? If so, share it!</p><p> <strong>Guided Activities:</strong> For beginners, some activities are better with a guide. If the audience is unable to join an in-person class, YouTube is a wonderful online alternative for guided activities such as yoga, meditation, and other exercise or relaxation activities.</p><p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Is there software you use particularly well? Are you skilled in the kitchen or the garage? Can you install appliances without reading the instructions? Give a step-by-step tutorial in completing a project.</p><h2 id="7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle"><a href="#7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle"></a><strong>7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle</strong></h2><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Whatever you are pursuing, know that there are many on the same path as you. If you are an aspiring dancer create content for those that are with you on the journey. Encourage them and speak authentically about the accomplishments to come. Motivation is the energy that is in circulation. The more you send out into the universe, the more will come back to you.</p><p><strong>Pets:</strong> If you share your home with animals, then you have no shortage of content. Point the camera at your dogs, cats, and ferrets for a while and see what ridiculous scenarios they get up to.</p><p><strong>Fitness and Food:</strong> Do you subscribe to a specific type of fitness and diet? Have you seen the results that you want to share? Yes, perfect! If no, then why not do a little experimentation. Try to include a fitness and diet regimen in your daily life and vlog about it. Who knows, it might become a healthy change.</p><p><strong>Tattoos, Piercing, or Scars:</strong> Every tattoo, piercing, and a scar on your body probably have an interesting story behind it. Whether it is something you are proud of or something you may prefer to hide, recognizing the different marks on your body and how they represent your history is a great way to reflect and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Document Your Journey:</strong> It’s important to set achievable goals for yourself. That’s how you can encourage progress within yourself. With a goal and a timeline in mind, it can be as simple as documenting your journey towards it. If you are working on your novel, you can do a vlog updating the viewers on your process and word count or even bringing a camera with you as your piece gets workshopped.</p><p><strong>Holiday:</strong> We all share memories of that wonderful time of year. For some it’s a spectacle for others it’s a modest affair. How do you celebrate the holidays and is there a story to that tradition?</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> So much of our identity is related to what we do for a living. Talking about your day job on YouTube can be tricky. Be authentic, but also use your discretion, because you don’t want to misrepresent yourself professionally to the world.</p><p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> What is your relationship with money, weekends, and your extended family? Thinking about your values can help you explore life philosophically, thus encouraging you to live the best life possible. As you speak about your philosophy, you are bound to experience alternative views, and that is where great content materializes.</p><p><strong>Haul:</strong> If you have some money to spend, create a haul YouTube video. Haul video involves you going on a shopping spree and bringing home a big “haul.” In essence, it is an unboxing video on steroids. This type of video generally involves fashion or groceries, but it can be related to anything in large quantity. It’s all about showing off your new stuff to the audience.</p><p><strong>Unboxing:</strong> Got something new from Amazon? Before you open it, turn on your camera. Unboxing is an easy YouTube video idea that allows your viewers who are considering buying the item to better understand whether it is in fact the right purchase for them.</p><h2 id="8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity"><a href="#8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity" class="headerlink" title="8. Nurture Your Curiosity"></a><strong>8. Nurture Your Curiosity</strong></h2><p><strong>Build Something:</strong> IKEA furniture, a website, a LEGO miniature, a business plan. The best way to get better at something is to just do it. Use your hands and build something and capture it for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong> It’s not only the entertainment industry that offers behind the scenes content, but many businesses offer tours and open houses. Reach out to any business or organization you are curious about the inner workings and odds are there will be a day where you can pop in and have a look at what it makes the wheels turn.</p><p><strong>Jargon and Slang:</strong> From fashion to baseball to dentistry, everything has its own set of jargon or slang. What’s a galloon? What does it mean to win the pennant? What is 3MOD? If you are interested in languages, then diving into the world of jargon and slang is an interesting one.</p><p><strong>Deconstruct a Process:</strong> Be like Tim Ferriss by breaking down a process into parts enabling you to learn a new skill faster, whether it be language or sports or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNtrp0M-qs4" >coffee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Show your viewer how to properly learn how to improve performance by simplifying.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> We all want to learn a new language, but it isn’t easy. If you have a knack for languages, show it off as a skill. Help new speakers avoid common mistakes, discuss the etymology of each word, and explore all the diverse dialects.</p><p><strong>Accents:</strong> How accents derive is a fascinating topic to explore if you are seeking good ideas for YouTube. Why do some accents sound like music while other sound abrasive? Why different neighborhoods in the same city have different accents? There are endless questions to explore. Even<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6cHEJIjYI" >constructed languages can be analyzed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for their accents.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> Are you interested in your city, your school, or the land your office is built upon? What was it like ten years ago? A hundred years ago? An exploration of history does not have to be about Rome or Mesopotamia, it can be about your backyard<br><strong>Debunking Myths:</strong> Before every MythBusters episode they warn you not to attempt any of their experiments, and we are not encouraging you to either. At least, not to their scale. There is a multitude of myths out there that can use your expert eye to explore. In your city itself, there are stories worth debunking or at least learning more about.</p><p><strong>Compare Two Things:</strong> Need something to do on YouTube? Why not compare diets such as Paleo vs Keto, devices such as Android vs iPhone, or a remake vs an original?</p><p><strong>Opposing Opinions:</strong> Do you have a friend who always has to argue with you about everything: films, values, politics? Well, don’t just save those conversations for private, invite him or her over and film a debate.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong> Go down the rabbit hole on a topic you are really fascinated about. Dissect every song from an artist, read every book by an author, or learn about a different type of plant growing in your community. Everywhere you look, you should see opportunities to get obsessed over a topic.</p><p><strong>Biography of Someone:</strong> It could be a famous person or it can be someone from your family. Tell their story in a way that only you can. Get interviews, do research, and find a personal connection. Every life is significant, now it is your chance to honor that.</p><p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Grab a deck of questions from Trivial Pursuit and pick a fun fact to explore. Use it as a jumping-off point for exploring an interesting topic. Share it with viewers who might not have known that they were interested in this fact.</p><p><strong>Timeline of a Topic:</strong> Pick any topic and trace the lineage and better understand how it has gotten to this point. Where did it begin, has it hit critical mass, and how has it evolved over the years?</p><h2 id="9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic"><a href="#9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic" class="headerlink" title="9. Be a Fan and a Critic"></a><strong>9. Be a Fan and a Critic</strong></h2><p><strong>Fanfiction:</strong> Continue a story of one of your favorite movie characters or explore the life of some secondary character in a television show that you enjoy. Use their existing storyline to guide where you toward an interesting YouTube video about how they could have evolved.</p><p><strong>Re-edit:</strong> Use your editing skills to recreate a classic movie scene, allowing it to have a completely different tone. Or mashup footage from a variety of sources to create an original piece of video content.  </p><p><strong>Speculation of Unreleased Entertainment:</strong> There are always rumors of upcoming movies, music, and books from famous filmmakers, musicians, and authors. Speculate on what the new release can possibly be about. Generate buzz and excitement and consider what you would do if you were put into the shoes of those famous creators.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on the Best</strong>: In every field, there are those that are considered world-class. How did they get there, what support did they get, and how are they working to stay at the top? Highlight their achievements and see what we can anticipate from them in the future.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Can you offer insights into a particular piece of work? Share it with the world and add another dimension to what the viewers have already seen.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on Something Not So Popular:</strong> Is there something you adore that nobody really knows about? You can be the one to help this become mainstream.</p><p><strong>Tribute:</strong> Pay tribute to a personality or an event from the past. Help people remember the significance of what happened from the past through your YouTube video.</p><p><strong>Shoutout:</strong> Like sending out a thank you card, use YouTube to publicly thank someone for doing something awesome! It’s like you are giving a toast to someone in front of the whole Internet, what an honor.</p><p><strong>Summarize a Book, Movie, or TV Show:</strong> Give the Coles note summary of a book, a movie, or TV show. Challenge yourself to make a summary that is as interesting as the actual source material.</p><p><strong>“Best of” Video:</strong> Select the best scenes from your favorite actor or the best plays from your favorite athlete and compile it into a video that highlights all the best moments.</p><h2 id="10-Create-Entertainment"><a href="#10-Create-Entertainment" class="headerlink" title="10. Create Entertainment"></a><strong>10. Create Entertainment</strong></h2><p><strong>Fails:</strong> Don’t get embarrassed, get views. Embrace your shortcomings and accept that everybody has failed at something. Be careful and don’t get hurt too bad though.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Channel your <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barelypolitical" >Key of Awesome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your own parody of something from pop culture. If you parody something trending, it can help you catch the wave of popularity and bring in views as all eyes are currently on that topic.</p><p><strong>Break Something:</strong> There is nothing like watching something get destroyed. Maybe that’s why the Will it Blend videos got so popular. No matter how we resist it, we enjoy seeing the destruction.</p><p><strong>Time Lapse:</strong> The growth of a plant, the flow of traffic, the rise and fall of the sun through your eyes. In this fast pace world, it’s fun to see organized chaos at a rapid rate.</p><p><strong>Screen Sharing:</strong> Let people watch you play a video game or give a tour of your desktop. Share your screen as you write a poem.</p><p><strong>Cinematography:</strong> There is always a place for beautiful cinematography on YouTube. Tell a great story about your life or your city with great moving images.</p><p><strong>Short subject documentary:</strong> Pick a topic that matters and explore in through the structure of a documentary. Remember that when making a documentary, think about it as making a movie – you are not there to lecture them. Can you get people<a class="link"   href="http://www.indiewire.com/2014/09/michael-moores-13-rules-for-making-documentary-films-22384/" >riled up as Michael Moore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does? Can you encourage people to take action? If yes, then you are ready to start making documentary-style YouTube videos.</p><p><strong>Lip-sync:</strong> Can’t sing but feel you have a musical gift to give to the world, well, they will never put you on the billboards for what you can do lip-syncing, but you can make a pretty entertaining YouTube video through this medium. It doesn’t even have to be music either, take <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gneBUA39mnI" >Bad Lip Reading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Impressions:</strong> A good impression is always worth a good laugh, and a bad one is almost as good. Give it a shot, pull up videos of some of your favorite celebrities, and film yourself attempting to mimic their voice, characteristics and expressions.</p><p><strong>Sketch Comedy, Short Film, or Role Play:</strong> Do you have characters and scenes in mind that will be perfect for SNL? Well, instead of having to go through Lorne Michaels, create the character yourself and publish your comedy sketch on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Interview:</strong> Find a subject matter experts and ask them interesting questions about their profession and areas of interest.</p><p><strong>Games:</strong> Play a game with your friends or other YouTubers and allow the competitiveness, frustration, and hilarity to ensue.</p><p>Okay!

Consequently, the quality of the audio recording determines whether or not your videos will be able to trigger ASMR. That’s why we selected some of the ASMR microphones novice and seasoned YouTubers can use to record the audio for their ASMR YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Which-Features-Should-an-ASMR-Microphone-Have"><a href="#Part-1-Which-Features-Should-an-ASMR-Microphone-Have" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Which Features Should an ASMR Microphone Have?"></a>Part 1: Which Features Should an ASMR Microphone Have?</h2><p>Thinking that you can use any microphone you can lay your hands on to record sound for you ASMR videos is a mistake, because the quality of the recording may not be at a satisfactory level if your microphone is producing a lot of self-noise or if it is not able to pick up soft noises.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at the features and ASMR microphone should have.</p><h3 id="1-The-mic’s-source-of-power"><a href="#1-The-mic’s-source-of-power" class="headerlink" title="1. The mic’s source of power"></a>1. The mic’s source of power</h3><p>A microphone can draw power from two sources, as you can either connect it to a computer via a USB cable or you can use an XLR cable to connect the device to an external power source.</p><p>The so-called Phantom Power can be any type of adapter or audio recorder that supplies a microphone with power. All professional condenser microphones are connected to a power source through an XLR connection although some mics can have a built-in phantom power source that requires only an AA battery to function normally.</p><h3 id="2-The-microphone’s-recording-direction"><a href="#2-The-microphone’s-recording-direction" class="headerlink" title="2. The microphone’s recording direction"></a>2. The microphone’s recording direction</h3><p>Although there are a number of direction categories of microphones, ASMR content produces commonly use Omnidirectional and Binaural mics.</p><p>As its name suggests, an omnidirectional microphone can pick up sounds from all sides, which makes it a good option if you want to record ambient sounds like brushing or tapping. However, you should also keep in mind that this type of microphone can capture background noises which may impact the overall quality of the recording.</p><p>The binaural mics are composed of two microphones are used to record the left and right channel separately. You don’t necessarily have to get a binaural microphone in order to create a binaural audio recording since you can just use two different microphones to record the left and right channels individually.</p><h3 id="3-The-level-of-self-noise-a-microphone-makes"><a href="#3-The-level-of-self-noise-a-microphone-makes" class="headerlink" title="3. The level of self-noise a microphone makes"></a>3. The level of self-noise a microphone makes</h3><p>Recording low sounds can be challenging if your microphone is creating humming or crackling noises automatically. The so-called self-noise level a microphone makes is quantified in A-weighted decibels, and ideally, you should get a mic that makes around 15dBA in order to keep sounds a microphone produces automatically at the very minimum.</p><p>Besides the self-noise, you should also look into S&#x2F;N (Signal to Noise Ratio) that depicts the ratio of signal power to noise power. A mic that has approximately 80dBA or more should enable you to record low voices without having to worry about the unwanted noises.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-The-Best-Budget-ASMR-Microphones-for-Beginners"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-The-Best-Budget-ASMR-Microphones-for-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are The Best Budget ASMR Microphones for Beginners?"></a>Part 2: What Are The Best Budget ASMR Microphones for Beginners?</h2><p>If you are thinking about starting an ASMR YouTube channel, you don’t have to get a professional microphone right away, because there lots of affordable mics that will enable you to create crystal-clear audio recordings.</p><p>We’ve shortlisted a few of the best budget ASMR microphones for beginners on the market with the aim to help you narrow down your choices.

Which type of microphone should be used to record ASMR sounds?"></a>2. Which type of microphone should be used to record ASMR sounds?</h4><p>Condenser microphones are a much better option than the dynamic mics because they pick up soft sounds easily.

Is an omnidirectional microphone better for ASMR than the binaural mic?</h4><p>The answer to this question depends on the type of ASMR video you want to create.

If you are on a budget, then a microphone like Blue Yeti may be a great choice, because it lets you choose between different polar patterns and it produces a great quality of sound.</p><p>On the other hand, 3Dio FS Pro II or Rode NT1-A Stereo microphones are worth investing in because they will enable you to record sound at a professional level.</p><p><img                       lazyload

Thumbnails will help viewers decide to watch your videos, and a personalized banner will tell people who you are and what your vlog is about. Watermarks both label your work as yours and protect it from theft. Your icon is the avatar you will use to communicate with your subscribers. You can totally change the look and feel of the page and the changes will carry forwards for the page display on all platforms. However, the elements might look slightly different on desktops, mobile devices, and TV screens.</p><h4 id="1-Banner"><a href="#1-Banner" class="headerlink" title="1. Banner"></a>1.

If you don’t plan this from the start, then all the effort you put into designing your channel art will be wasted, as it will either not display properly or will just look terrible. YouTube has provided these guidelines for channel art designs:</p><ul><li>The file size must not exceed 6MB</li><li>The image should ideally be 2560 x 1440 pixels</li><li>The minimum image size is 2048 x 1152 pixels</li><li>The maximum width is 2560 x 423 pixels</li></ul><p><strong>The ideal dimensions for different devices are listed below:</strong></p><ul><li>Mobile:1546px * 423px</li><li>Tablet :1855px * 423px</li><li>Desktop:2560px * 423px</li><li>TV:2560px * 1440px</li></ul><p>You see, YouTube channel art 2560*1440 px is ideal for TV devices.

Use the ‘safe area’ displayed on YouTube to ensure your logo and branding is correct on every screen size.</p><h3 id="Part-3-Why-should-you-care-about-channel-art"><a href="#Part-3-Why-should-you-care-about-channel-art" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why should you care about channel art?"></a>Part 3: Why should you care about channel art?</h3><p>If you’re wondering if you should really be bothered about channel art, the answer is you absolutely should. Channel art is all about branding, and in today’s cluttered web world, having a strong, recognizable brand is crucial.

Tips for Making Thumbnails"></a>1. Tips for Making Thumbnails</h4><p>A thumbnail is an image that represents your video in YouTube’s search results. There are things you can do with your thumbnail that will make it more likely to get clicked on. Always upload your own thumbnail rather than relying on the one YouTube automatically chooses, and make sure the thumbnail you use is related to the content of your video.</p><p>One of the most important things to remember is that thumbnails are small. It is better if there is not a lot going on in them because details will be hard to see. If there is any text in your thumbnail make sure it is huge so that people can still read it once it has been shrunken down.</p><p>If you are making a thumbnail for a vlog entry then choose a shot that has you in it, particularly one where you are not too far away from the camera. It is also a good idea if the thumbnails for your vlog entries all look similar so it is easy for people browsing to recognize which videos are yours.</p><h4 id="2-Tips-for-Making-Watermarks"><a href="#2-Tips-for-Making-Watermarks" class="headerlink" title="2. Tips for Making Watermarks"></a>2. Tips for Making Watermarks</h4><p>Watermarks work best when they are small and transparent so they do not distract viewers from your videos. If your watermark is colored, there should not be more than one or two colors. Unlike the full version of your logo, you do not want your watermark to be overly eye-catching.</p><h4 id="3-Tips-for-Making-Icons"><a href="#3-Tips-for-Making-Icons" class="headerlink" title="3. Tips for Making Icons"></a>3. Tips for Making Icons</h4><p>Watermarks work best when they are small and transparent so they do not distract viewers from your videos.

With some of the easy-to-use, powerful tools that are available out there, you can make some beautiful, professional-looking channel art in no time at all. Here are six of our favorite tools for creating amazing youtube channel art:</p><h4 id="1-Photoshop"><a href="#1-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="1. Photoshop"></a>1. Photoshop</h4><p>Produced by Adobe, Photoshop has been leading the way in professional design software for many years. When it comes to creating logos, banners, editing photos and more, nothing really comes close to the power of this software. While the professional version of Photoshop can set you back several hundreds of dollars, Photoshop Elements is much more affordable at around the $100 mark, and has enough functionality to do most things you’d need for your channel art.</p><p>New from Adobe is Adobe Spark Post, a free-to-use <a class="link"   href="https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker" >web and iOS app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which has been specifically designed to help you create beautiful channel art. Although it can only provide basic channel art without much in the way of editing tools, if you’re new to graphic design and want a free, user-friendly way to create your art, this could be worth considering.</p><h4 id="2-Wondershare-PixStudio"><a href="#2-Wondershare-PixStudio" class="headerlink" title="2. Wondershare PixStudio"></a>2. Wondershare PixStudio</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-tools-to-create-channel-art.jpg"                      alt="YouTube channel art maker - PixStudio"                ></p><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform provides a wonderful creative design solution for you. Just through drag and drop templates, and then use photos&#x2F;text&#x2F;elements to design. After the simple and fast design, One-Click to download your creations, and share to your Facebook, Instagram Story, and YouTube Thumbnails, etc. immediately.</p><p>This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.</p><h4 id="3-Fotor"><a href="#3-Fotor" class="headerlink" title="3. Fotor"></a>3. Fotor</h4><p>For a good, user-friendly way to create professional-looking YouTube channel art, Fotor is a pretty solid choice. Using a simple drag and drop interface, users can create a unique channel banner using preset designs or even uploading their own artwork.</p><p>The developers of Fotor have built in a bespoke banner maker, preset to the exact size required for YouTube channel art. This makes it easier than ever to ensure you develop excellent channel art which will display correctly on any device. Editing is limited, so advanced designers will probably find it all a bit too simplistic, but for the man on the street, this is a perfect choice.</p><h4 id="4-Canva"><a href="#4-Canva" class="headerlink" title="4. Canva"></a>4. Canva</h4><p>Canva really stands out from the competition for the number of customizable design elements present on the website. From shapes to backgrounds, images to text, there are thousands of awesome, professional-looking elements to choose from to create your unique channel art.</p><p>Similar to Fotor, those who know what they’re doing in the design field will find it lacking in functionality, and there’s an irritating glitch where you can’t stretch more than one image to the ends of the canvas. Watch out for premium design elements too, as lots require payment, although usually not more than a dollar or two.</p><h4 id="5-PicMonkey"><a href="#5-PicMonkey" class="headerlink" title="5. PicMonkey"></a>5. PicMonkey</h4><p>For a good middle ground between expensive but powerful Photoshop and free but limited options like Canva and Fotor, PicMonkey is a great solution. It has plenty of design functionality, from working with layers to performing tasks like blending, and you can free draw and erase parts of your image too.</p><p>We found PicMonkey capable of pretty much everything you’d need to create a professional YouTube banner, and it’s a fair bit more user friendly than Photoshop too. It’s not free, but at a cost of $7.99 per month, it’s pretty affordable for what you get.</p><h4 id="6-Snappa"><a href="#6-Snappa" class="headerlink" title="6. Snappa"></a>6. Snappa</h4><p>Another web-based freemium service, Snappa has the added advantage of coming pre-loaded with all the dimensions of popular social channel’s banners, profile images and more, including YouTube. That means you can work on your channel art directly, seeing clearly which parts will be displayed on what devices.</p><p>The drawback to this particular platform is the sheer volume of stock images already on the site. There are some nice ones, but due to the lack of organization you need to scroll through quite a few mediocre options to find them. There’s also a fairly ungenerous limit on how many items you can create and save without upgrading, but the pro version is fairly affordable at just $10 a month.</p><p>There are many other services out there to help you create your YouTube channel art and what’s best for you will depend on the type of channel art you’re looking to create, as well as your own abilities with graphic design.

This is achieved using a simple process of clicking “import” from the “file” drop-down menu. Once you have finished importing your photos or video files, you can then drag them from the sidebar and into the editing area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-interface.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h5><ul><li>If the videos you want to import are already published online, you can start the process by first downloading them directly from YouTube first, making sure to save them as MP4 files.</li><li>The best way of importing videos from YouTube is by using an innovative video converter like Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate. This program will help in downloading and converting files to a format that is supported by Adobe Premier.</li></ul><h4 id="Step-2-Editing"><a href="#Step-2-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Editing"></a>Step 2: Editing</h4><p> The next step in how edit YouTube videos with Adobe Premiere is to start modifying the video files or photos the way you want. To achieve this, click on “Effects Control” and apply the desired effects. If you want to insert some text or words into your video, select “title” and then click “new title.” Now choose how you would like the words to behave, for instance, “Default Roll” makes the text roll upwards in the page.</p><p> Now drag the text that you have created into the editor area. If you want to edit the text, simply double-click to select it, and it will bring up a separate page where you can make further edits. You can then modify the text, font, and the positioning as well. This page also allows you to set whether the text will crawl or roll.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-text-with-premiere-pro-3.jpg"                                     ></p><p> The final part of the process is to import your chosen audio file. This could be the chosen soundtrack for your presentation. Simply drag the audio file onto your editor.

This means you will need to save the edited file first on your computer and ensure you use a YouTube supported format.

This is the preferred format for YouTube and Video uploads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-unleashing-the-power-of-youtube-short-form-videos/"><u>In 2024, Unleashing the Power of YouTube Short Form Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/future-pioneers-8-rapidly-expanding-video-ventures-for-2024/"><u>Future Pioneers 8  Rapidly Expanding Video Ventures for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-from-game-day-to-hollywood-sports-video-success-story/"><u>[New] From Game Day to Hollywood  Sports Video Success Story</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-make-the-most-of-your-tunes-top-5-tools-for-converting-spotify-to-youtube-playlists/"><u>In 2024, Make the Most of Your Tunes  Top 5 Tools for Converting Spotify to YouTube Playlists</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-harnessing-online-revenue-multiplatform-studio-use/"><u>2024 Approved  Harnessing Online Revenue  Multiplatform Studio Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-from-barely-there-to-top-rated-the-youtube-growth-arc/"><u>[New] From Barely There to Top Rated  The Youtube Growth Arc</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/finding-the-ideal-format-for-your-youtube-videos-for-2024/"><u>Finding the Ideal Format for Your YouTube Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/making-your-youtube-content-stand-out-with-engaging-subtitle-designs-for-2024/"><u>Making Your YouTube Content Stand Out with Engaging Subtitle Designs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-cloud-stop-motion-studio-features-guidelines-and-more/"><u>The Ultimate Cloud Stop Motion Studio Features, Guidelines, and More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-delving-into-tseries-streaming-revenue-model-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] Delving Into TSeries' Streaming Revenue Model on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-snapchat-share-tweets-via-video/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Snapchat  Share Tweets via Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-web-based-video-editing-software-with-music-features/"><u>2024 Approved Best Web-Based Video Editing Software with Music Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-authenticity-on-instagrams-platform/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Mastering Authenticity on Instagram's Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/navigating-global-reach-via-vimeo-links-for-2024/"><u>Navigating Global Reach via Vimeo Links for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-initiating-meetings-on-the-move-tech-advice-for-2024/"><u>[New] Initiating Meetings on the Move  Tech Advice for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-top-10-text-presets-for-visual-impact/"><u>[New] Top 10 Text Presets for Visual Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-imei-number-of-realme-gt-neo-5-through-google-earth-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Track IMEI Number Of Realme GT Neo 5 Through Google Earth?</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Since YouTube is a visual media platform, viewers set their eyes on the thumbnails first before they read the title of the video. If you’ve made a collage of YouTube thumbnails or designed YouTube channel art containing various freeze-frame images from different YouTube videos, you are no stranger to needing a fast way to collect YouTube thumbnail images. Online, there are several tools dedicated to solving this exact problem. These are the top five YouTube Thumbnail grabbers:</p><p>These thumbnails can be then be used in videos, blogs, articles, web pages, etc. Let’s have a look at 8 best thumbnail grabbers in the market:</p><ol><li><a href="#youtubegrabber1">YouTube Thumbnail Grabber</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber2">BoingBoing</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber3">Thumbnailsave.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber4">Get YouTube Thumbnail</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber5">Fbutube.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber6">YT Thumbnail Downloader</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber7">Youtubethumbnailimage.com</a></li><li><a href="#youtubegrabber8">Youthumbnail.com</a></li></ol><h2 id="1-YouTube-Thumbnail-Grabber"><a href="#1-YouTube-Thumbnail-Grabber" class="headerlink" title="#1: YouTube Thumbnail Grabber"></a>#1: YouTube Thumbnail Grabber</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-grabber.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail Grabber"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com/" >https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>YouTube Thumbnail Grabber is at the top of our list. The website is very simple and clean with no ads. All you need to do is enter the YouTube video URL and click on the “Download Images” button. The site will then present you with your downloadable images in different sizes. It’s free and fast!</p><h2 id="2-BoingBoing"><a href="#2-BoingBoing" class="headerlink" title="#2: BoingBoing"></a>#2: BoingBoing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boing-boing.jpg"                      alt="Boing Boing"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://boingboing.net/features/getthumbs.html" >https://boingboing.net/features/getthumbs.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>BoingBoing is faster than YouTube Thumbnail grabber because it skips the “Download Images” step. As soon as you enter in your YouTube video URL, BoingBoing will automatically present you with your downloadable images.

Are Good For Travel Vlogging</p><p>Every travel vlogger should have a <strong>wide-angle lens</strong>. Wide-angle lenses fit much more of a scene into your camera frame, making it ideal for capturing establishing shots. You’ll also need a wide-angle lens if you plan on holding your camera out in front of yourself with an extended arm to get selfie footage.</p><p>As a travel vlogger, you’ll also want to show some close-up shots of the various subjects in your scene. If you don’t mind walking up to these subjects, the lens I recommend for this is a <strong>standard lens</strong>.</p><p>If, however, you want to be able to shoot these close-up shots from a farther distance, you’ll need a <strong>telephoto lens</strong>.</p><p>But you probably don’t want to carry and switch so many lenses as you travel, right? A convenient solution is to get a zoom lens that covers a wide range of focal lengths. For example, travel vlogger Sam Kolder shoots with a Canon EF 24-105mm f&#x2F;4 lens – that’s a wide-angle lens, standard lens, and telephoto lens all in one lens!</p><p>If most of your travel video shooting will be done handheld, you should also definitely look for a lens equipped with <strong>optical image stabilization</strong>.</p><p>Check out my <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Camera Lens for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to gain a more in-depth understanding of lenses and how they work.</p><h3 id="1-2-Travel-Vlogging-Accessories"><a href="#1-2-Travel-Vlogging-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Travel Vlogging Accessories"></a>1.2 Travel Vlogging Accessories</h3><p><strong>Camera Accessories That Are Good For Travel Vlogging</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tripod1.jpg"                      alt="Travel Tripod"                ></th><th><strong>1.

Travel Vlog</strong></p><p>Travel vlogging, the kind where you film yourself just going about your day in a different part of the world, is a great way to not only document your travel moments and memories for yourself, but also a great way to share your experience with others.</p><p>Rather than being too picky with your video shots and possibly ending up with a lack of footage to work with, shoot as much as you can.</p><p>Try to capture your thoughts and feelings around the things you taste, smell, see and hear. Sharing these details can help your viewers feel more like they’re with you on your travels.</p><p> <strong>2. Tips or Tricks for Traveling</strong></p><p>Although learning from mistakes during your travels can be a rewarding experience, most people want to avoid them and, rather, enjoy their trip as much as they possibly can. After all, travel, for most people, happens in intervals that seem too short. You can help this sizable group by offering travel tips and tricks.</p><p>Prepare a list of tips and tricks, a shot list of all the footage you’ll need to go along with those tips, and then capture all your footage. As you go through your list, you can then cut away to your associated travel shots.</p><p> <strong>3. Video Tour of a Location</strong></p><p>Many people are curious about different parts of the world and would love to join a tour without the high cost of flights, hotels, meals, and admission tickets. Give them that experience by making a video tour.</p><p> <strong>4. Review An Attraction or Experience</strong></p><p>A lot of travelers having a limited amount of time and money to enjoy their chosen travel destinations want to know which attractions and experiences to prioritize and which ones to skip. Help them make their decision by making a video review.</p><p> <strong>5. Timelapse Videos</strong></p><p>All you need in addition to your camera is a tripod to get started with making timelapse videos. Your tripod stabilizes your shot as your camera captures all the changes that take place in a given location.</p><p>When your footage is sped up, your viewers can appreciate all the changes that take place that they may not have had the patience to sit through in real-time. It’s also interesting to observe the passage of time in a different way.</p><p> <strong>6. Average Daily Cost</strong></p><p>Before going on a trip, many people try to make a budget and figure out how much money to exchange into foreign currency. Making a good budget and getting just enough foreign cash, though, requires you to know how much, on average, things cost.</p><p>Make a helpful video on the average cost of daily expenses including meals and transportation like Paolo did in the above video “Average Daily Cost in Tokyo Japan | Is it Expensive?.” His video actually helped me a lot when I was trying to come up with a budget for my recent trip to Japan.</p><p> <strong>7. Interview Locals</strong></p><p>People don’t travel only to see popular attractions. A lot of people travel to connect with and understand people from different parts of the world.</p><p>Interviewing locals and sharing their thoughts can help to provide that kind of connection.</p><p> <strong>8. What’s in My Backpack?</strong></p><p>Packing for a trip can say a lot about who you are as a person because it involves prioritizing items based on your personal values.</p><p>For your next trip, share a little part of yourself with your audience through a video about the things you’ve packed in your bag.</p><p> <strong>9. Talk About Your Own Home City</strong></p><p>When you’ve lived in your own home city for so long, you might forget that people all over the world may marvel at the things you take for granted because all those things just happen to be at your doorstep.</p><p>Take advantage of the expert that you already are in your own home city and make an informative video for others who are taking a trip there.</p><p> <strong>10. How To Become a Travel Vlogger</strong></p><p>After you’ve done a lot of travel vlogging and learned so much along the way, you can make a video about how to be a travel vlogger.</p><p>In the above video, Andrew Santos teaches how to make a travel video, all while hilariously poking fun at many of the cliché trends in the travel genre.</p><h2 id="PART-3-TRAVEL-VIDEO-EDITING"><a href="#PART-3-TRAVEL-VIDEO-EDITING" class="headerlink" title="PART 3: TRAVEL VIDEO EDITING"></a>PART 3: TRAVEL VIDEO EDITING</h2><h4 id="Video-Editing-Software"><a href="#Video-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Video Editing Software"></a>Video Editing Software</h4><p>When it comes to editing your travel video together, there are different kinds of software you can do that with.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>FREE VIDEO EDITING SOFTWARE</strong></th><th><strong>PAID VIDEO EDITING SOFTWARE</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a class="link"   href="https://www.openshot.org/" >OpenShot Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows, Mac, Linux) <a class="link"   href="https://shotcut.org/" >ShotCut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows, Mac, Linux) <a class="link"   href="https://hitfilm.com/express" >Hitfilm Express <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows, Mac) <a class="link"   href="http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html" >VideoPad Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows) <a class="link"   href="https://www.lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows, Mac, Linux) <a class="link"   href="http://www.videosoftdev.com/" >VSDC Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows) <a class="link"   href="http://www.machetesoft.com/home/about-machete-video-editor-lite.html" >Machete Video Editor Lite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows) <a class="link"   href="http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/" >Avidemux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD) Read more about each software in our post about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >The Best Free Video Editing Software for YouTube – Top 8 Reviews <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows, Mac) - start at $49.99 for one year license and Free trial <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/ca/final-cut-pro/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Mac) - $299.99, Free trial <a class="link"   href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/ca/vegas-movie-studio/" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows) - $49.99</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Travel-Themed-Video-Effects"><a href="#Travel-Themed-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Travel-Themed Video Effects"></a>Travel-Themed Video Effects</h4><p>If you use Filmora Video Editor, you can also take advantage of a variety of travel-themed video effects packs, like the one shown in the above video, filled with titles, transitions, filters, overlays, and other visual elements.</p><p>For my recent trip to Japan, I actually used Filmora Effects’ Japanese set.</p><p>At the 2:10 mark of the above video, I used an overlay of falling cherry blossom leaves.

Otherwise, keep your SLR camera concealed.</li><li>Never leave your equipment unattended in a visible area, not even in a locked car.</li></ul><p> <strong>Pre-Production and Planning</strong></p><ul><li>Before shooting, make a shot list of all the footage you need.</li><li>Have all your filming equipment that needs to be calibrated all calibrated and ready to use.</li></ul><p> <strong>Onscreen Performance</strong></p><ul><li>Look into your lens, not the projected image of yourself on your camera’s flip screen.</li><li>Show a lot of energy as you film yourself.</li><li>If you’re nervous about talking to the camera in public, keep your talking head clips short and gradually build your way up to longer clips. You can break up longer sentences by saying a few words from one scene, saying a few more in another, and finishing off your last words, again, in another scene. Later, in editing, you can stitch all of those clips together to make one fluid sentence.</li><li>If you’re nervous about talking to the camera in public, you can capture your talking headshots later when you find a more secluded space.</li></ul><p> <strong>Audio Recording</strong></p><ul><li>Silence everything you don’t want your mic to record.</li><li>Put your mobile phone in airplane mode.</li><li>Block wind from reaching your mic with windscreens and dead cats.</li><li>Upgrade your mic.</li><li>Adjust your levels.</li><li>Get close to the sound you are wanting to record.</li></ul><p>Check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/10-recording-tips-to-get-the-best-sound-from-your-390.html" >10 Recording Tips to Get The Best Sound From Your Microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more audio recording tips.</p><p> <strong>Filming</strong></p><ul><li>To avoid crowds, wake up early and grab your footage early while everyone else is still sleeping or getting ready.</li><li>Capture wide shots, medium shots, and close-up shots for better coverage.</li><li>Use the Sun Seeker app to set up your sunrise&#x2F;sunset shots better.</li><li>If your camera can record 4K footage, record in 4K all the scenes that you want to zoom in closer later in editing without losing quality (your video project in editing has to be at 1920p x 1080p for this to work).</li></ul><p> <strong>Stabilization</strong></p><ul><li>If you’re trying to get shots with movement by walking, rather than walking as you normally would walk with your knees bent for steadier shots.</li><li>If you’re shooting something in front of your handheld, lean your arm against your own body for steadier shots.</li><li>Use a stabilizing gimbal with your camera.</li></ul><p> <strong>Timelapse&#x2F;Hyperlapse</strong></p><ul><li>Select scenes where you can see a lot of change over time (not a still building in front of a cloudless smoggy sky).</li><li>Set longer intervals for scenes that change very slowly over time.</li><li>Pre-set your focus. Turn autofocus off.</li><li>Shoot time-lapses&#x2F;hyper-lapses in manual mode to prevent the flickering that occurs with changing light conditions in automatic settings.</li><li>If your camera is set on a tripod in a fixed position, turn your optical image stabilization off.</li><li>If you aren’t holding onto your camera as it’s in the middle of making a timelapse video, at least keep your camera and tripod attached by some kind of leash mechanism.</li><li>For moving time-lapses or hyper-lapses, try to keep one point of reference in the same position within your camera frame.</li></ul><p> <strong>Slow Motion</strong></p><ul><li>Shoot slow-motion videos when there is plenty of light.</li><li>For actions that are as slow as walking, slowing down your footage to 50% of the original speed looks good enough. If your video editing project is in 30 fps, shooting your video in 60 fps will give you a 50% slow-motion video. If your video editing project is in 60 fps, shooting your video in 120 fps will give you a 50% slow-motion video. Any slower is overkill for slowing down the speed of walking.</li><li>For actions that are as fast as water splashing, slowing down your footage as little as 15% of the original speed can look good. For a video editing project in 30 fps, you would need a camera that can shoot at up to 240 fps to slow your footage down this much.</li></ul><p> <strong>Storage and Back-Up</strong></p><ul><li>If you’re using a phone that can store images and videos on a separate SD card, take advantage of that and record your travel footage onto your SD card. Later, you can easily get to your travel media as it will all be in one place.</li><li>If you have your laptop on you, regularly transfer your media files from your cameras to your external hard drives.</li><li>If you don’t want to bring your laptop on your trip and plan to video edit once you’re back home, use a USB memory card reader that connects with an app on your phone to transfer your files into your external hard drive.</li><li>If you have access to a reliable internet connection and you leave your laptop at your place of accommodation, have your computer upload your files onto cloud storage while you are out to travel vlogging.</li><li>Take advantage of Google Photos’ free, unlimited cloud storage for video files up to 1080p.</li></ul><p> <strong>Video Editing</strong></p><ul><li>If you’re editing a video project with videos from multiple different cameras, make sure to set the correct time and date on all of them before you start filming. Later, in editing, you can import all your image and video files and sort them in the exact order that they were taken.</li><li>If your video editing software can work with proxies, transcode all your video files into proxy files for much faster editing.</li></ul><p> <strong>Posting On YouTube</strong></p><ul><li>Choose a title that people will search for. Keep your target keywords at the beginning of your title. “S01E01: My Summer Backpacking Trip” is not an effective title. Instead, a title like “Going Up The Eiffel Tower… Beautiful View of Paris!” would be better.</li></ul><h2 id="Ready-to-Become-a-Travel-Vlogger"><a href="#Ready-to-Become-a-Travel-Vlogger" class="headerlink" title="Ready to Become a Travel Vlogger?"></a>Ready to Become a Travel Vlogger?</h2><p>Here in this article, I shared travel vlogging cameras &amp;accessories, travel video ideas&amp; resources, and travel vlogging tips.

However, the tools they provide are too basic. If you want to perform a more complex editing, you will need an offline editor such as Windows Movie Maker, iMovei or Adobe Premiere. But if you are looking for an simple while powerful tool, we highly recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is highly compatible with different image, audio, and video format. It is just as simple as importing the video and editing them.</p><p>The <strong>downside</strong>, however, is that you will lose the original ID of the video. This may serve as a problem if you have already shared the video before since the views may disappear. A good solution to this problem is to place an annotation to the old video telling your followers that you have created a better quality of the video then direct them to the link.</p><p>Check how to engage your audience to stay tuned from this video below:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Edit-Existing-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Edit-Existing-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Edit Existing YouTube Videos"></a>Edit Existing YouTube Videos</h2><p>Let me walk you through a familiar situation, you spend all night trying to make your video perfect, uploaded it on your YouTube channel and shred it to your social media accounts. Then you noticed that you need to repair something. The normal approach back then is to delete the video, re-edit using offline tools and then re-upload it again. Clearly, this process takes too much time. Furthermore, it changes the ID of your video which means that the previous embed will no longer work.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Under this situation, you can’t add more footage or effects to the existing videos.</p><h4 id="1-Sigin-in"><a href="#1-Sigin-in" class="headerlink" title="1.

Choosing the best camera lens for your YouTube channel can be tricky because there are so many options. This article will walk you through some of them, and make two recommendations of great vlogging lenses. If you already have a good understanding of how camera lenses work then feel free to scroll down to the lens recs.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-Lenses-Zoom-lens-Fixed-lens-aperture-f-stop"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-Lenses-Zoom-lens-Fixed-lens-aperture-f-stop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding Lenses: Zoom lens, Fixed lens, aperture, f-stop"></a>Part 1. Understanding Lenses: Zoom lens, Fixed lens, aperture, f-stop</h2><p>There are two main categories of camera lenses: ‘zoom’ – lenses that allow you to zoom in and out – and ‘fixed’. If your lenses are tools then zoom lenses are Swiss army knives; they are very versatile. Fixed lenses, also called prime lenses, have more specific purposes. Do you need a tool that can do a lot of things, or a tool that is perfect for one specific job? Sometimes it is useful to have access to both.</p><p>We have explained the differences between Fixed lens and Zoom lens and advantages of using each lens, check this article: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Zoom Lens vs. Fixed Lenses: Which one is best for YouTuber? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for the detailed information.</p><p>Before we get into the recommendations here is a little background information on lenses in general:</p><h3 id="Beginner’s-Guide-to-Aperture-and-F-Stops"><a href="#Beginner’s-Guide-to-Aperture-and-F-Stops" class="headerlink" title="Beginner’s Guide to Aperture and F-Stops"></a>Beginner’s Guide to Aperture and F-Stops</h3><p>In order to be able to select the lens you’ll be using to record your YouTube videos, you first need to understand a few very basic concepts, such as aperture or f-stops.</p><h4 id="1-What-is-a-lens’s-aperture"><a href="#1-What-is-a-lens’s-aperture" class="headerlink" title="1.What is a lens’s aperture?"></a>1.What is a lens’s aperture?</h4><p>The aperture of your lens is the hole through which light reaches your camera’s sensor, or the film if you are using a film camera. The wider your aperture is the more light you are letting into your camera. In low light it is better to have a wide aperture, and when you are working with a lot of light it is better to have a narrow aperture so your footage is not overexposed.</p><p><strong>Aperture</strong> is simply an opening in the lens that lets the light through. If you want to increase the amount of the light that is reaching the camera’s sensor you need to open up the aperture blades that are located in the lens. The <strong>f-values</strong> like f&#x2F;1.2 or f&#x2F;1.8 indicate that the aperture is wide open and that the camera is receiving the maximum amount of light a lens you’re using can provide.</p><h4 id="2-What-is-an-‘f-stop’"><a href="#2-What-is-an-‘f-stop’" class="headerlink" title="2.What is an ‘f-stop’?"></a>2.What is an ‘f-stop’?</h4><p>Light passes through your lens’s aperture on its way to your camera’s sensor, and the f-stop of your lens relates to the amount of light it lets in. The lower your f-stop, the wider your aperture, and the more light you are letting into your camera. The more light you let into your camera the easier it is to achieve a blurred background. A lot of vloggers love blurring their backgrounds because it is a quick way to disguising the rooms they are shooting in.</p><p>F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.8’ or ‘f&#x2F;4’ on your lens. For more information on f-stops and blurring your background read “The Best Bokeh Lens - How to Get the Blurred Background for YouTube Videos” and watch Tasha’s video.</p><p><strong>F-stops</strong> or f-numbers indicate how open the aperture is, so for example if your camera is displaying f&#x2F;32 value it means that your camera is letting very little light to get through to the camera’s sensor. The f-number depends on a few other parameters such as shutter speed, exposure or ISO values. Large apertures provide a shallow depth of field which creates a smooth and artistic background blur, while a small aperture enables you to keep both the background and the foreground of your shot in focus.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Camera-Lenses"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Camera-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Types of Camera Lenses"></a>Part 2: Types of Camera Lenses</h2><p>The visual aspect of a video may not be the only thing you’ll have to dedicate special attention to while recording your YouTube video, but it is surely one of the most important factors of the video production process. A lens you are using will largely contribute to the aesthetics of the video. That’s why you need to know which type of lens will deliver the best results when shooting different types of scenes. Here are some of the most common types of lenses you’ll encounter.</p><h4 id="Standard-lenses"><a href="#Standard-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Standard lenses"></a>Standard lenses</h4><p>These lenses are featured in almost all camera kits, so the chances are that if you have a DSLR camera you already have a standard, mid-range lens. These lenses commonly have a fixed 50mm focal length, although zoom lenses with focal lengths in the range between 35mm and 75mm are also considered standard. You can use them to capture medium shots, single or multiple figure shots, and in some cases establishing shots, because they offer enough versatility to cover a multitude of different scenes. Standard lenses often have large apertures, which makes them quite useful if you often shoot videos under light conditions you can’t control.</p><h4 id="Macro-lenses"><a href="#Macro-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Macro lenses"></a>Macro lenses</h4><p>Details, product shots or any other subject that can be filmed from close proximity looks better if they are recorded with macro lenses. The high contrast and sharpness these lenses provide allow you to create stunning close-ups of all hosts, guests or actors in your YouTube videos. What’s more, if you are presenting a new product to your audience you can use the macro lens to make some captivating shots that will attract more audience. Zoom lenses can also be used for macro photography and video, although prime macro lenses produce better results.</p><h4 id="Telephoto-lenses"><a href="#Telephoto-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Telephoto lenses"></a>Telephoto lenses</h4><p>The subjects of your videos don’t always have to be in your immediate surroundings, because telephoto lenses let you capture scenes that are several miles away from you. Wildlife or sports videographers frequently use telephoto lenses because they don’t have another way of getting close to their subjects. However, telephoto lenses with 70-300mm focal length can also be used to take stunning portraits or close up shots. The biggest downside of telephoto lenses is their weight because the lenses with higher focal lengths can weigh up to 10lbs, which makes them a bit inconvenient to always carry with you.</p><h4 id="Wide-angle-lenses"><a href="#Wide-angle-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Wide-angle lenses"></a>Wide-angle lenses</h4><p>Recording videos of vast open spaces, breathtaking vistas or beautiful city views is much easier if you have a wide-angle lens. The short focal length allows the lens to have a wider field of view which covers more space than standard or telephoto lenses. Wide-angle lenses also have lower apertures than lenses with longer focal lengths which results in images that have a shallow depth of field. Ultra-wide lenses like fisheye distort the view so the videos recorded with these lenses often suffer from the lack of realism.</p><h4 id="Specialist-lenses"><a href="#Specialist-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Specialist lenses"></a>Specialist lenses</h4><p>YouTubers who are working on demanding projects can try to solve their troubles by using a specialist lens. Soft-focus lenses can help you take better portraits while tilt-shift lenses allow you to control the perspective. However, it is hard to imagine a scenario in which you’ll need a specialist lense if you are just starting out since even experienced videographers only use special lenses when they have absolutely no better way to record a scene.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Recommended-Best-Camera-Lenses-for-Shooting-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Recommended-Best-Camera-Lenses-for-Shooting-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Recommended Best Camera Lenses for Shooting YouTube Videos"></a>Part 3: Recommended Best Camera Lenses for Shooting YouTube Videos</h2><p>Here are a couple great lenses that might be good fits for you and your YouTube channel. The thing that makes them both ideal for vlogging is that they have low enough f-stops to blur out your background.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Camera Lens</th><th><strong>Type</strong></th><th><strong>Price</strong></th><th><strong>Aperture</strong></th><th><strong>Focal Length</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Canon EF-S 10-18mm f&#x2F;4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens</strong></td><td>Wide angle</td><td>$279</td><td>f&#x2F;4.5-5.6</td><td>10 -18mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rokinon 8mm f&#x2F;3.5</strong></td><td>Fisheye</td><td>$249</td><td>f&#x2F;3.5</td><td>8mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Canon 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 STM Lens</strong></td><td>Prime</td><td>$125</td><td>f&#x2F;1.8</td><td>50mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Canon EF 135mm f&#x2F;2L USM Lens</strong></td><td>Telephoto</td><td>$999</td><td>f&#x2F;2</td><td>135mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f&#x2F;2.8</strong></td><td>Standard Zoom</td><td>$299</td><td>f&#x2F;2.8</td><td>17 -50mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sony 30mm f&#x2F;3.5 Macro</strong></td><td>Macro</td><td>$278</td><td>f&#x2F;3.5</td><td>30mm</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="1-Canon-EF-S-10-18mm-f-4-5-5-6-IS-STM-Lens"><a href="#1-Canon-EF-S-10-18mm-f-4-5-5-6-IS-STM-Lens" class="headerlink" title="1. Canon EF-S 10-18mm f&#x2F;4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens"></a>1. Canon EF-S 10-18mm f&#x2F;4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens</h4><p>Canon released this lens in 2014 and shortly after it has gained the reputation of one of the most reliable wide to <strong>ultra-wide lenses</strong> for Canon cameras. Like most STM lenses, it offers incredibly <strong>fast autofocus technology</strong> that makes it a great choice for fast-paced action videos. The lens is equipped with an <strong>image stabilization system</strong> which guarantees that your videos are going to remain <strong>sharp</strong> even if the camera wasn’t perfectly still while you were recording. Somewhat smaller aperture range makes this lens <strong>poor choice for low light scenes</strong>, although you can get decent results if you manage to keep the camera still.</p><h4 id="2-Rokinon-8mm-Ultra-Wide-f-3-5-Fisheye-Lens"><a href="#2-Rokinon-8mm-Ultra-Wide-f-3-5-Fisheye-Lens" class="headerlink" title="2. Rokinon 8mm Ultra Wide f&#x2F;3.5 Fisheye Lens"></a>2. Rokinon 8mm Ultra Wide f&#x2F;3.5 Fisheye Lens</h4><p><strong>Outdoor videos</strong> look much cooler when they are recorded with a <strong>wide-angle lens</strong> because the wider field of view enables you to capture more space in a shot. <strong>Fisheye lenses</strong> were made popular by GoPro cameras because they make the videos look more fun while producing high image quality. Rokinon 8mm lens allows you to <strong>adjust focus and aperture manually</strong> so you can fine-tune your shot before hitting the record button. To make things even better this model is <strong>compatible with a wide range of cameras including Pentax, Canon or Nikon DSLRs.</strong> It has a relatively <strong>fast aperture</strong> that enables it to deliver <strong>solid performances under low light conditions</strong>.</p><h4 id="3-Canon-EF-50mm-f-1-8-STM-Lens"><a href="#3-Canon-EF-50mm-f-1-8-STM-Lens" class="headerlink" title="3. Canon EF 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 STM Lens"></a>3. Canon EF 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 STM Lens</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec01.JPG"                      alt="camera lens"                ></p><p>The EF 50mm is a fixed lens with an f-stop of 1.8, which means it is great for blurring your background and performs well even in poorer lighting conditions. This is a really great lens for an opinion or beauty vlog, where you do not need to move around. You can stay put right where the focus is sharpest and stand out by blurring everything behind you. If you tend to reuse the same sets then you do not really need a zoom feature. If your shooting conditions rarely change then it is just as easy to use a reliable fixed lens like the EF 50mm since you will not need to be rethinking your set up and adjusting.</p><p>If you are looking for an inexpensive prime lens that lets you create sharp videos with shallow depth of field, you should look no further. This model is one of three Canon’s 50mm prime lenses, although the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Standard-Medium-Telephoto-Cameras/dp/B00009XVCZ/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-3&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=11bff1019e73f0462c30a04e98d4874f&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTe" >50mm f&#x2F;1.4 USM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-Lens-Digital-Cameras/dp/B000I1YIDQ/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-4&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=d77bb813550f12e8aa72c8738dfaad81&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTeAiw&slot" >50mm f&#x2F;1.2 ‘L’ USM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> models are much more expensive. You can use it to record a lot of different types of YouTube videos, like product reviews or makeup tutorials. The 50 mm f&#x2F;1.8 STM lens doesn’t have image stabilization technology so you should try to be as still as you can possibly be when shooting handheld videos in order to avoid recording footage that has a lot of camera shakes.</p><h4 id="4-Canon-EF-135mm-f-2L-USM-Lens"><a href="#4-Canon-EF-135mm-f-2L-USM-Lens" class="headerlink" title="4. Canon EF 135mm f&#x2F;2L USM Lens"></a>4. Canon EF 135mm f&#x2F;2L USM Lens</h4><p>Recording <strong>moving objects</strong> from a distance requires you to have a lens that allows you to smoothly track their movements while keeping the subject in focus. The Canon EF 135mm f2&#x2F;L USM lens is perhaps one of the best telephoto lenses on the market because it uses L glass that is widely accepted as the best in the industry. The Canon’s telephoto lens is compatible with ASP-C and Full Frame EF mount cameras. Keep in mind that this is also a prime lens and you can’t increase or decrease its focal length, but even so, it is a perfect choice for documentary-style videos.</p><h4 id="5-Tamron-SP-AF-17-50mm-f-2-8-XR-Di-II-LD-Aspherical-IF-Lens"><a href="#5-Tamron-SP-AF-17-50mm-f-2-8-XR-Di-II-LD-Aspherical-IF-Lens" class="headerlink" title="5. Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f&#x2F;2.8 XR Di II LD Aspherical (IF) Lens"></a>5. Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f&#x2F;2.8 XR Di II LD Aspherical (IF) Lens</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec02.JPG"                      alt="camera lens rec02"                ></p><p>The Tamron’s standard zoom lens offers good value at a very reasonable price. The maximum aperture is f&#x2F;2.8, while the minimum aperture value this lens supports is f&#x2F;32, which means that its users can easily experiment with different <strong>depths of field.</strong> The lens is <strong>compatible with most Canon cameras</strong> so if you have a camera from another manufacturer you may have to use the lens adapter in order to mount it onto your camera. Like most standard zoom lenses, Tamron SP AF model is <strong>highly versatile</strong> and you can use it to record <strong>a wide range of different scenes</strong>.</p><p>A lot of zoom lenses do not have wide enough apertures to create blurred backgrounds, but this Tamron lens is an exception at f&#x2F;2.8. This low f-stop also means that it performs better in poor lighting conditions than a lot of other zoom lenses. If your shooting conditions change a lot – if you often change locations, for example – then it will be good to have a sturdy, well-built, zoom lens like the AF 17-mm that can be quickly adapted to new angles and distances.</p><h4 id="6-Sony-30mm-f-3-5-Macro"><a href="#6-Sony-30mm-f-3-5-Macro" class="headerlink" title="6. Sony 30mm f&#x2F;3.5 Macro"></a>6. Sony 30mm f&#x2F;3.5 Macro</h4><p>All Sony’s APS-C format E mount cameras are compatible with this multi-purpose lens. When mounted the 30mm lens provides a 45mm focal length equivalent, which means that you can use it to take macro shots of products or to record medium or close-up shots. This is a prime lens, so changing the focal length isn’t really an option, but the 1:1 life-size magnification, as well as the 0.9-inch working distance, allow you to get close to the subjects in the video. The aperture range is between f&#x2F;3.5 and f&#x2F;22 which means that you can choose how shallow the depth of field in your shot should be.</p><p>If you are using a 4k camera to shoot your YouTube video, check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best camera lens for 4k professional production. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/integrating-wirecast-into-your-youtube-livestream-strategy-for-2024/"><u>Integrating WireCast Into Your YouTube Livestream Strategy for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/from-free-to-fiscal-determining-view-counts-for-youtube-earnings-for-2024/"><u>From Free to Fiscal  Determining View Counts for YouTube Earnings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-of-8-youtube-mistakes-to-evade/"><u>2024 Approved  The Ultimate List of 8 Youtube Mistakes to Evade</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-leverage-youtubes-potential-through-strategic-backlinking/"><u>In 2024, Leverage YouTube's Potential Through Strategic Backlinking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-hit-the-floor-with-optimal-posting-hours/"><u>In 2024, Hit the Floor with Optimal Posting Hours</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-explore-the-best-anime-worlds-on-youtube-your-new-2023-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Explore the Best-Anime Worlds on YouTube  Your New 2023 Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-unleash-youtubes-earning-potential-with-strategic-short-videos/"><u>In 2024, Unleash YouTube's Earning Potential with Strategic Short Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-accelerating-recording-speed-and-clarity-techniques/"><u>[Updated] Accelerating Recording Speed & Clarity Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-fixes-to-solve-iphone-15-pro-max-randomly-asking-for-apple-id-password-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Complete Fixes To Solve iPhone 15 Pro Max Randomly Asking for Apple ID Password | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-essentials-checklist-for-evaluating-vidma-recorder-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essentials Checklist for Evaluating Vidma Recorder for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-ipogo-will-be-the-new-ispoofer-on-realme-narzo-n55-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Realme Narzo N55? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-tiktok-screen-real-estate-optimizing-aspect-ratio/"><u>New 2024 Approved TikTok Screen Real Estate Optimizing Aspect Ratio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/best-3-samsung-galaxy-f15-5g-emulator-for-mac-to-run-your-wanted-android-apps-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Best 3 Samsung Galaxy F15 5G Emulator for Mac to Run Your Wanted Android Apps | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-leave-a-life360-group-on-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How To Leave a Life360 Group On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Without Anyone Knowing? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-30-powerful-bots-for-a-thriving-discord-hub/"><u>[New] In 2024, 30 Powerful Bots for a Thriving Discord Hub</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
