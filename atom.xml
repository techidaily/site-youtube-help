There are some points to be considered while creating a thumbnail for Youtube. We will provide you with the best practices that we have learned throughout our journey of using Youtube and growing it from zero.</p><p>7 best practices can help you make your Youtube thumbnail stand out from the crowd and make its way out.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Show-your-face"><a href="#Show-your-face" class="headerlink" title="Show your face"></a>Show your face</h4></li></ol><p>In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png"                      alt="comparison-of-showing-face-or-not"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li></ol><p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png"                      alt="simple-fonts-recommended"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Phrases-not-sentence"><a href="#Use-Phrases-not-sentence" class="headerlink" title="Use Phrases, not sentence"></a>Use Phrases, not sentence</h4></li></ol><p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage.png"                      alt="piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-phrases-not-sentences.jpg"                      alt="use-phrases-not-sentences"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Put-every-stuff-on-left-side"><a href="#Put-every-stuff-on-left-side" class="headerlink" title="Put every stuff on left side"></a>Put every stuff on left side</h4></li></ol><p>When we navigate to a Youtube thumbnail and place the cursor on it, it shows us two icons, “Watch Later” and “Add to Queue,” located on its right size. Come on, you don’t want your beautiful thumbnail that cost you a few hours be covered. To avoid these icons from hiding your important stuff of thumbnail, make sure to put everything on the right side of your thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/put-stuff-on-left.jpg"                      alt="put-stuff-on-left"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Have-a-unique-and-Consistent-style"><a href="#Have-a-unique-and-Consistent-style" class="headerlink" title="Have a unique and Consistent style"></a>Have a unique and Consistent style</h4></li></ol><p>Try to make all your thumbnails follow the same style.

It is one of the best ways to show the viewers the content of your video even when they don’t click on your video. These three seconds will help them decide whether to click on your video or not. This preview is selected by the system from the first half of your video according to its relevance and similarity with the topic. That’s why it is very important to add related information in the first half of the video, otherwise, Youtube will choose it randomly. If the preview is not selected for two days, it means your video is not eligible for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-preview-wisely.gif"                      alt="choose-preview-wisely"                ></p><hr><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Fortnite-Thumbnail-Super-Fast-and-Free"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Fortnite-Thumbnail-Super-Fast-and-Free" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Fortnite Thumbnail Super Fast and Free?"></a>How to Make a Fortnite Thumbnail Super Fast and Free?</h2><p>Many of you might be interested in how to make a fortnite thumbnail, so here it is.

Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png"                      alt="comparison-of-showing-face-or-not"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts-1"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li></ol><p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png"                      alt="simple-fonts-recommended"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Phrases-not-sentence-1"><a href="#Use-Phrases-not-sentence-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Phrases, not sentence"></a>Use Phrases, not sentence</h4></li></ol><p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage.png"                      alt="piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-phrases-not-sentences.jpg"                      alt="use-phrases-not-sentences"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Put-every-stuff-on-left-side-1"><a href="#Put-every-stuff-on-left-side-1" class="headerlink" title="Put every stuff on left side"></a>Put every stuff on left side</h4></li></ol><p>When we navigate to a Youtube thumbnail and place the cursor on it, it shows us two icons, “Watch Later” and “Add to Queue,” located on its right size.

Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png"                      alt="comparison-of-showing-face-or-not"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts-2"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts-2" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li></ol><p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png"                      alt="simple-fonts-recommended"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Phrases-not-sentence-2"><a href="#Use-Phrases-not-sentence-2" class="headerlink" title="Use Phrases, not sentence"></a>Use Phrases, not sentence</h4></li></ol><p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens.

Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png"                      alt="comparison-of-showing-face-or-not"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts-3"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts-3" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li></ol><p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png"                      alt="simple-fonts-recommended"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Phrases-not-sentence-3"><a href="#Use-Phrases-not-sentence-3" class="headerlink" title="Use Phrases, not sentence"></a>Use Phrases, not sentence</h4></li></ol><p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens.

However, there are a few guidelines that your clips must comply with so that the streaming platform could specifically identify them as YouTube Shorts. These norms include:</p><ul><li>Your videos must not be more than 60 seconds long in duration</li><li>They must be shot in portrait orientation, ideally in the 9:16 aspect ratio</li><li>The title or the description must contain ‘#Shorts’ (without quotes) in it</li></ul><p>Once you have a video recorded using the first two guidelines from the above list, you can use the instructions given below to upload the media on YouTube:</p><h4 id="Step-1-Select-a-Short-Video-to-Upload"><a href="#Step-1-Select-a-Short-Video-to-Upload" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Select a Short Video to Upload"></a>Step 1: Select a Short Video to Upload</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-short-videos-on-youtube-pc.jpg"                      alt="Upload YouTube Shorts Video to desktop"                ></p><p>Launch your favorite web browser on your PC, go to YouTube, make sure to sign in to your YouTube account, click the <strong>Create</strong> (<strong>Camera</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the web page, click <strong>SELECT FILES</strong> on the <strong>Upload videos</strong> window, and locate, select, and upload a short video from your PC to the portal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-short-videos-interface-on-youtube-pc.jpg"                      alt="Upload YouTube Shorts Video"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Mark-the-Video-as-Short"><a href="#Step-2-Mark-the-Video-as-Short" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Mark the Video as Short"></a>Step 2: Mark the Video as Short</h4><p>On the <strong>Details</strong> window that appears, add <strong>#Shorts</strong> in the <strong>Title</strong> or <strong>Description</strong> field, optionally pick a thumbnail from the suggested images present under the <strong>Thumbnail</strong> section (or upload a custom picture from your PC), select your preferred radio button from under the <strong>Audience</strong> section, make the other necessary changes if need be, and click <strong>NEXT</strong>.

How you set up your talking-head shot depends on many factors, including how much space you have, what kind of look you’re going for, and how many people you want to fit in one frame. Here are four ways to set up your talking-head shots for YouTube.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Table of Contents <a href="#Close-Quarters-Wide-Angle-Vlog-Set-Up">1.

It is welcomed to share on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/talking-heads-youtube-video-shots-set-up.jpg"                      alt=" Setting up Talking Heads Video Shots for YouTube"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Set-Up-Your-Talking-Head-Shots-for-YouTube-4-Ways"><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-Your-Talking-Head-Shots-for-YouTube-4-Ways" class="headerlink" title="How to Set Up Your Talking-Head Shots for YouTube [4 Ways]"></a>How to Set Up Your Talking-Head Shots for YouTube [4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="1-Close-Quarters-Wide-Angle-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#1-Close-Quarters-Wide-Angle-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up"></a>1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>Don’t have a lot of space to set up your camera and lighting equipment? No problem! You can be within an arm’s length away from your camera with a close quarters wide-angle vlog set-up.</p><p>With this set-up, you’re going to need a camera with a wide-angle lens, a tripod, a camera-mounted shotgun mic for sound, and a ring light for light.</p><p>Set your camera on the tripod and mount the shotgun mic directly on the camera shoe (the electronic bracket on the top of the camera). Inside the circular space of your ring light, position your camera right in the middle of it so that you can shoot your video through it without getting any part of the lighting equipment in your shot.</p><p>In the video above, Sean Cannell demonstrates this set-up. As you can see from this example, the wide-angle lens is able to squeeze in a lot of what’s in front of the camera into the shot.</p><p>Objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame will appear more stretched out as the wide-angle causes distortion and enhances perspectives.</p><p>If you look closely into Sean’s eyes, you can also see a specular highlight in the shape of a circle. Many people like the way eyes look against a ring light.</p><h3 id="2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up"></a>2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you have more space and want to shoot a more professional-looking talking-head shot with more realistic perspectives, a medium vlog set-up may be a better alternative for you.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll be using a slightly longer standard&#x2F;normal lens (like a 35mm or a 50mm lens) attached to your camera which would be set on a tripod. Since this longer lens will show less of the surrounding areas as it “zooms” closer into whatever is in front, you will need to sit further back, away from your camera.</p><p>Now that you’re further away from your camera, a camera-mounted shotgun mic may not be the best mic for you. For better sound recording, you’ll need a shotgun mic fixed on a mic stand that is set up like a boom mic, positioned just outside of your camera frame.</p><p>At the 39 second mark of the above video, electronic music producer deadmau5 is positioned right in the center of this particular set-up.</p><p>You can see from how even the background and couch looks across the entire camera frame that there is no distortion or enhanced perspective.</p><p>It appears that, to the right of deadmau5 (camera left), there is a key light and to his left (camera right) there may be a fill light for additional lighting. Behind the couch, there’s also a background uplight to create depth between the subject and the background. At the 1:30 mark of this trailer video, you can briefly see how the Masterclass camera crew set up their shot.</p><h3 id="3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up"></a>3.

Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up"></a>1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>Don’t have a lot of space to set up your camera and lighting equipment? No problem! You can be within an arm’s length away from your camera with a close quarters wide-angle vlog set-up.</p><p>With this set-up, you’re going to need a camera with a wide-angle lens, a tripod, a camera-mounted shotgun mic for sound, and a ring light for light.</p><p>Set your camera on the tripod and mount the shotgun mic directly on the camera shoe (the electronic bracket on the top of the camera). Inside the circular space of your ring light, position your camera right in the middle of it so that you can shoot your video through it without getting any part of the lighting equipment in your shot.</p><p>In the video above, Sean Cannell demonstrates this set-up. As you can see from this example, the wide-angle lens is able to squeeze in a lot of what’s in front of the camera into the shot.</p><p>Objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame will appear more stretched out as the wide-angle causes distortion and enhances perspectives.</p><p>If you look closely into Sean’s eyes, you can also see a specular highlight in the shape of a circle. Many people like the way eyes look against a ring light.</p><h3 id="2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up-1"><a href="#2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up-1" class="headerlink" title="2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up"></a>2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you have more space and want to shoot a more professional-looking talking-head shot with more realistic perspectives, a medium vlog set-up may be a better alternative for you.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll be using a slightly longer standard&#x2F;normal lens (like a 35mm or a 50mm lens) attached to your camera which would be set on a tripod. Since this longer lens will show less of the surrounding areas as it “zooms” closer into whatever is in front, you will need to sit further back, away from your camera.</p><p>Now that you’re further away from your camera, a camera-mounted shotgun mic may not be the best mic for you. For better sound recording, you’ll need a shotgun mic fixed on a mic stand that is set up like a boom mic, positioned just outside of your camera frame.</p><p>At the 39 second mark of the above video, electronic music producer deadmau5 is positioned right in the center of this particular set-up.</p><p>You can see from how even the background and couch looks across the entire camera frame that there is no distortion or enhanced perspective.</p><p>It appears that, to the right of deadmau5 (camera left), there is a key light and to his left (camera right) there may be a fill light for additional lighting. Behind the couch, there’s also a background uplight to create depth between the subject and the background.

Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up"></a>1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>Don’t have a lot of space to set up your camera and lighting equipment? No problem! You can be within an arm’s length away from your camera with a close quarters wide-angle vlog set-up.</p><p>With this set-up, you’re going to need a camera with a wide-angle lens, a tripod, a camera-mounted shotgun mic for sound, and a ring light for light.</p><p>Set your camera on the tripod and mount the shotgun mic directly on the camera shoe (the electronic bracket on the top of the camera). Inside the circular space of your ring light, position your camera right in the middle of it so that you can shoot your video through it without getting any part of the lighting equipment in your shot.</p><p>In the video above, Sean Cannell demonstrates this set-up. As you can see from this example, the wide-angle lens is able to squeeze in a lot of what’s in front of the camera into the shot.</p><p>Objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame will appear more stretched out as the wide-angle causes distortion and enhances perspectives.</p><p>If you look closely into Sean’s eyes, you can also see a specular highlight in the shape of a circle. Many people like the way eyes look against a ring light.</p><h3 id="2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up-3"><a href="#2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up"></a>2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you have more space and want to shoot a more professional-looking talking-head shot with more realistic perspectives, a medium vlog set-up may be a better alternative for you.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll be using a slightly longer standard&#x2F;normal lens (like a 35mm or a 50mm lens) attached to your camera which would be set on a tripod. Since this longer lens will show less of the surrounding areas as it “zooms” closer into whatever is in front, you will need to sit further back, away from your camera.</p><p>Now that you’re further away from your camera, a camera-mounted shotgun mic may not be the best mic for you. For better sound recording, you’ll need a shotgun mic fixed on a mic stand that is set up like a boom mic, positioned just outside of your camera frame.</p><p>At the 39 second mark of the above video, electronic music producer deadmau5 is positioned right in the center of this particular set-up.</p><p>You can see from how even the background and couch looks across the entire camera frame that there is no distortion or enhanced perspective.</p><p>It appears that, to the right of deadmau5 (camera left), there is a key light and to his left (camera right) there may be a fill light for additional lighting. Behind the couch, there’s also a background uplight to create depth between the subject and the background. At the 1:30 mark of this trailer video, you can briefly see how the Masterclass camera crew set up their shot.</p><h3 id="3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up-3"><a href="#3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up"></a>3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If your talking-head shot has got to include two people, you can use a similar set-up as the medium vlog set-up detailed above.</p><p>If you look back at the 39-second mark of deadmau5’s Masterclass trailer, you can see that there’s a lot of space to the left and right of deadmau5. Now imagine the same shot but with two people.</p><p>With two people, though, you’ll want to set up your mic slightly differently. Rather than using a directional shotgun mic with a narrow area of sensitivity, you’ll want to use a directional mic with a wider area of sensitivity.</p><h3 id="4-Long-Teleprompter-Vlog-Set-Up-3"><a href="#4-Long-Teleprompter-Vlog-Set-Up-3" class="headerlink" title="4.  Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up"></a>4.  Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you want to read over a script but still make it appear like you’re looking straight into the camera, you’ll need to use a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll need all the same equipment as the medium vlog set-up, but you’ll additionally need a teleprompter placed in front of your camera equipped with a long telephoto lens.</p><p>You will have to sit much further back away from your camera for two main reasons. Firstly, you want to be able to fit yourself in your much more zoomed-in camera frame (effect of the long telephoto lens). Secondly, you want to be far enough that the camera cannot detect your eyes reading from left to right. You’ll want to be around six meters away from a 17” teleprompter monitor or around four meters away from a 10” teleprompter monitor.</p><p>In the above video, Jared Polin uses a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>In the video, he says there’s about 8 feet (2.4 meters) between himself and his lens. At the 1:15 mark of his video, Jared demonstrates how this set-up works.</p><p>It is difficult to know whether the movement in his eyes is caused by not being far enough from the lens or from his horizontal nystagmus condition in his eyes.</p><p>Looking to find the right lights for your video recording set?

You could start by listing your hobbies and looking for trends with those, or by thinking about what types of videos you like to make the most. How could what you do for a living inspire your channel or your knowledge of a particular topic?</p><p>The key is to discover where you can bring something unique or interesting to YouTube, hopefully by combining your passions, hobbies, and knowledge into one big ball of brilliance. For example, if you’re keen to do cooking tutorials but spent a year traveling Asia, why not do Asian-inspired cooking? Or if you have a passion for fashion but work as a recruitment consultant, why not offer content about dressing for work and interviews?</p><p>This sweet spot where your passion and talents meet with your video genre is where you’ll find your ultimate niche lurking.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?"></a>Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?</h2><p>Finding a niche is all about giving your viewers what they want to see. Imagine you travel and upload vlogs about your travels every day. Almost all of your content is about travel, but then one day, randomly, you upload a video about cooking food. Your video was popular, you got more than 30k views, but only five people subscribed to your channel; why?</p><p>The answer is simple. If those who viewed the cooking video considered subscribing, they would have clicked onto your channel and seen that none of your other videos were about this topic. Despite uploading a good video, you seemed irrelevant to them, so they didn’t bother.</p><p>From the point of view of your subscribers, they want to know what you’re all about. They need to feel confident that, when they subscribe to you, they’ll be getting lots of quality content about the things they are most interested in. Having a clear and focused niche will allow you to do this for them.</p><h2 id="Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche"><a href="#Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche"></a>Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche</h2><p>The smaller and more specific your focus, the easier you’ll find it to get and hold onto subscribers. For example, if you’re niche is about dog training, why not focus on even more about doing it about training pugs? If you’re doing a parenting vlog, make it more specific by doing a parenting vlog for mums of boys, or twins, or toddlers.</p><p>By narrowing down your focus, your audience will be much easier to market to and to appeal to. When someone from your target audience finds your channel, they’re going to think ‘wow, this is just what I’ve been looking for’, and they’ll watch, like, share and interact with your videos way more than someone who is just a little bit interested.</p><h2 id="How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips"><a href="#How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]"></a>How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]</h2><p>If you’re still at a loss of how to identify the best niche for your YouTube channel, let us help. Here are some key things to think about when looking for your niche which will help you get where you need to be:</p><ul><li><strong>What are you good at? What are you passionate about?</strong></li></ul><p>Make a list of things you’re good at. Don’t be modest now, this isn’t the time. Think about what other people would ask for your help with, and what you’re most confident with. Getting to grips with what you have a talent for is a great place to start.</p><p>An example of this is PONY Syndrome, a makeup artist renowned for her Taylor Swift transformation. She found that people would often come to her for makeup advice, so she started making videos of her techniques. Fast forward a couple of years and she’s got four million subscribers and a profitable YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pony-effect.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You might not think you’re an ‘expert’ in an area, but often it’s the interesting combination of your talents and passions that makes you unique. Coach Tulin is a wonderful lady who is of a plus size but who is also passionate about fitness. She’s made a popular channel that demonstrates how to modify popular exercises to make them accessible for plus-size people, as well as showing just how to fit plus-size people can be! Her fan base is smaller, at 89k subscribers, but she’s still a big influencer in her field.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/coach-tulin.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Subscribers who get help from you are more likely to come back to you time and again. Although we all have a good laugh watching cat videos and other entertaining clips, the YouTube channels that tend to make the most money are those which genuinely help people.</p><ul><li><strong>Is there an audience for your potential niche?</strong></li></ul><p>Once you’ve got an idea about your potential niche, you’ll need to make sure there are actually people out there who want to watch it. To test this out, think about a video you could make for your niche and try looking it up on YouTube. If there are a ton of results, your niche is probably not focused enough. If there are zero results, probably nobody is looking for that type of video.</p><p>You’re looking for somewhere in between the two extremes. If a couple of well-established channels have made a video or two on your topic, but haven’t really focused on it, you can be confident that there is an audience out there but not too much competition. You could also look for something that there are a lot of blog posts or websites about and be the first to migrate the content to YouTube.</p><p>For example, if you were to search ‘makeup tutorial’, you’ll find around 23 million results. Most of these are from established influencers who have already pretty much cornered the market, so getting a foot in the door as a new YouTuber here is going to be tough. That’s not to say you shouldn’t do it, but you’ll have to work hard to make your channel stand out. Be original, put your own spin on the genre and you’ll get there eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>If you were to start drilling down into that niche, you’ll start to see where the opportunities exist. For example, if you narrow down your makeup search for ‘makeup tutorial for Asian male’, the results are in the region of 496k videos, a good deal less than the high-level outcome. If this was your passion, your talent and you could make great videos about it, you stand a good chance of breaking into this niche relatively easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-2.jpg"                                     ></p><ul><li><strong>What will you do differently to other channels?</strong></li></ul><p>With so much content out there to view, you’re not going to make your millions on YouTube if you’re boring. Viewers know that fun, quality content is out there, and will seek to find someone better than you if you’re too ‘run of the mill’ for their taste. People come to YouTube for information, but stick around for personality, so inject some of yours into everything you do.</p><p>There are loads of ways you can bring excitement and engagement to your YouTube channel. Think about the way you look, the way you talk, how your introduction is made, the effects used in your video, the overall concept, the direction of the camera work… the possibilities for making unique and exciting videos are pretty much limitless, but you’ll need to get creative if you want to stand out from the crowd.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you make money in this niche?</strong></li></ul><p>The majority of people start YouTube channels with big dreams of making millions from their work. However, if you’re in the wrong niche to start with, you could fall flat on your face before you even start. Researching whether it’s possible to monetize your YouTube niche is crucial; here’s how to find out:</p><ol><li>Will a company be likely to sponsor you to use their products?</li><li>Can you create a ‘side business’ alongside your channel?</li></ol><p>Sponsorship can be super lucrative, but very difficult to secure. Is there a company out there that has products you could use in your videos? If so, do they already have preferred YouTubers that they sponsor? As for a side business, you could look to doing anything from offering one-to-one consultancy to selling products via Amazon on an affiliate deal. The important thing is that you need to have a plan from the start.</p><p>Check out the most profitable niches for monetizing your YouTube channel below.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you generate enough content in this niche?</strong></li></ul><p>How many topics can you think of to make videos about for your channel? If you can’t think of at least 10 off the top of your head, that’s not a good sign. You’re going to need lots of ideas and inspiration for your YouTube videos, and if you’re already struggling to think of things to do, imagine how much you’ll be struggling two, three or four years down the line.</p><p>You need to absolutely love and be inspired by your niche because chances are you’ll be making videos on this topic for many years to come. Are you completely sure that you’ll be as enthusiastic about this topic next year? Will your passion for the content stand the test of time? Try to project how your life will change over the coming years and whether your niche will be suited to you as time goes on.</p><h2 id="Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches"><a href="#Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches" class="headerlink" title="Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]"></a>Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]</h2><p>There are some YouTube niches that are easier to monetize than others. That’s not to say you should restrict yourself to only these niches, but if you’re stuck for inspiration, you’ll find these focused areas are a good place to start your search.</p><p><strong>#1 Makeup</strong></p><p>By far and away one of the most popular YouTube niches, makeup can be a great place to start. Although you’ll find lots of competition here, there is a massive audience too.</p><p><strong>#2 Gaming</strong></p><p>Gaming YouTubers are probably the most well-known; who hasn’t heard of PewDiePie? And they’re making money doing the thing they love most: gaming. It’s tough to stand out in this crowded niche, but if you can be fresh and different, you could start building your own fan base.</p><p><strong>#3 Food</strong></p><p>If you love to cook (or even just to eat!) food channels can be fab. Showing off recipes is a tried and tested moneymaker, as is showing how to use gadgets and tools in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>#4 Tech review</strong></p><p>We’re all using technology at home, at work, and in our pockets, and want to know that we’re buying the right stuff and using it the right way. People are hungry for this type of content, whether it’s apps and software or physical hardware.</p><p><strong>#5 Travel</strong></p><p>Travel channels have some of the sexiest content on the web, and people love to see what the world is like out there. Invest in a good action camera and find an angle to the places your visit, such as the best places to eat, hidden gems, etc.</p><p><strong>#6 Fashion</strong></p><p>Fashion can be great for YouTube, from reviewing clothing items to keeping your audience updated on the latest trends. It’s a great niche for getting sponsors and earning from affiliate marketing too.</p><p><strong>#7 Sports</strong></p><p>You’ll never run out of content if you’re busy keeping people up to date with their favorite sports teams. Just be careful not to show copyrighted material as you could find your hard work being taken down.</p><p><strong>#8 Animals</strong></p><p>It was cat video’s that birthed the notion of a viral video, and even today hilarious animal clips can garner a huge audience. As well as animals doing funny things, you could also make videos about animal care, training, and reviews of pet products.</p><p><strong>#9 Photography</strong></p><p>Thousands of budding photographers look to YouTube for good advice on how to take better shots. Photography channels can also review equipment and can benefit from affiliate links for these.</p><p><strong>#10 Movies</strong></p><p>If you’re a movie buff, why not take your opinions of the big screen to the small (and often tiny) screen? Post reviews, do top tens, or even create parodies of movies yourself. Just watch out for that copyright issue again.</p><p><strong>#11 How-to tutorials</strong></p><p>Everyone needs to know something in their life, whether it’s how to tie their shoelaces or how to change a spark plug on a car. Answering these ‘how to…’ questions could get you ranking highly and gathering millions of views.</p><p><strong># 12 Music</strong></p><p>You have to be careful when doing a music channel, as you’re unlikely to get permission to play actual tracks. However, you could do commentaries on music news, give advice on instrument care or even teach people how to play.

Here are some key things to think about when looking for your niche which will help you get where you need to be:</p><ul><li><strong>What are you good at? What are you passionate about?</strong></li></ul><p>Make a list of things you’re good at. Don’t be modest now, this isn’t the time. Think about what other people would ask for your help with, and what you’re most confident with. Getting to grips with what you have a talent for is a great place to start.</p><p>An example of this is PONY Syndrome, a makeup artist renowned for her Taylor Swift transformation. She found that people would often come to her for makeup advice, so she started making videos of her techniques. Fast forward a couple of years and she’s got four million subscribers and a profitable YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pony-effect.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You might not think you’re an ‘expert’ in an area, but often it’s the interesting combination of your talents and passions that makes you unique. Coach Tulin is a wonderful lady who is of a plus size but who is also passionate about fitness. She’s made a popular channel that demonstrates how to modify popular exercises to make them accessible for plus-size people, as well as showing just how to fit plus-size people can be! Her fan base is smaller, at 89k subscribers, but she’s still a big influencer in her field.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/coach-tulin.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Subscribers who get help from you are more likely to come back to you time and again. Although we all have a good laugh watching cat videos and other entertaining clips, the YouTube channels that tend to make the most money are those which genuinely help people.</p><ul><li><strong>Is there an audience for your potential niche?</strong></li></ul><p>Once you’ve got an idea about your potential niche, you’ll need to make sure there are actually people out there who want to watch it. To test this out, think about a video you could make for your niche and try looking it up on YouTube. If there are a ton of results, your niche is probably not focused enough. If there are zero results, probably nobody is looking for that type of video.</p><p>You’re looking for somewhere in between the two extremes. If a couple of well-established channels have made a video or two on your topic, but haven’t really focused on it, you can be confident that there is an audience out there but not too much competition. You could also look for something that there are a lot of blog posts or websites about and be the first to migrate the content to YouTube.</p><p>For example, if you were to search ‘makeup tutorial’, you’ll find around 23 million results. Most of these are from established influencers who have already pretty much cornered the market, so getting a foot in the door as a new YouTuber here is going to be tough. That’s not to say you shouldn’t do it, but you’ll have to work hard to make your channel stand out. Be original, put your own spin on the genre and you’ll get there eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>If you were to start drilling down into that niche, you’ll start to see where the opportunities exist. For example, if you narrow down your makeup search for ‘makeup tutorial for Asian male’, the results are in the region of 496k videos, a good deal less than the high-level outcome. If this was your passion, your talent and you could make great videos about it, you stand a good chance of breaking into this niche relatively easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-2.jpg"                                     ></p><ul><li><strong>What will you do differently to other channels?</strong></li></ul><p>With so much content out there to view, you’re not going to make your millions on YouTube if you’re boring. Viewers know that fun, quality content is out there, and will seek to find someone better than you if you’re too ‘run of the mill’ for their taste. People come to YouTube for information, but stick around for personality, so inject some of yours into everything you do.</p><p>There are loads of ways you can bring excitement and engagement to your YouTube channel. Think about the way you look, the way you talk, how your introduction is made, the effects used in your video, the overall concept, the direction of the camera work… the possibilities for making unique and exciting videos are pretty much limitless, but you’ll need to get creative if you want to stand out from the crowd.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you make money in this niche?</strong></li></ul><p>The majority of people start YouTube channels with big dreams of making millions from their work. However, if you’re in the wrong niche to start with, you could fall flat on your face before you even start. Researching whether it’s possible to monetize your YouTube niche is crucial; here’s how to find out:</p><ol><li>Will a company be likely to sponsor you to use their products?</li><li>Can you create a ‘side business’ alongside your channel?</li></ol><p>Sponsorship can be super lucrative, but very difficult to secure. Is there a company out there that has products you could use in your videos? If so, do they already have preferred YouTubers that they sponsor? As for a side business, you could look to doing anything from offering one-to-one consultancy to selling products via Amazon on an affiliate deal. The important thing is that you need to have a plan from the start.</p><p>Check out the most profitable niches for monetizing your YouTube channel below.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you generate enough content in this niche?</strong></li></ul><p>How many topics can you think of to make videos about for your channel? If you can’t think of at least 10 off the top of your head, that’s not a good sign. You’re going to need lots of ideas and inspiration for your YouTube videos, and if you’re already struggling to think of things to do, imagine how much you’ll be struggling two, three or four years down the line.</p><p>You need to absolutely love and be inspired by your niche because chances are you’ll be making videos on this topic for many years to come. Are you completely sure that you’ll be as enthusiastic about this topic next year? Will your passion for the content stand the test of time? Try to project how your life will change over the coming years and whether your niche will be suited to you as time goes on.</p><h2 id="Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches-1"><a href="#Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches-1" class="headerlink" title="Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]"></a>Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]</h2><p>There are some YouTube niches that are easier to monetize than others. That’s not to say you should restrict yourself to only these niches, but if you’re stuck for inspiration, you’ll find these focused areas are a good place to start your search.</p><p><strong>#1 Makeup</strong></p><p>By far and away one of the most popular YouTube niches, makeup can be a great place to start. Although you’ll find lots of competition here, there is a massive audience too.</p><p><strong>#2 Gaming</strong></p><p>Gaming YouTubers are probably the most well-known; who hasn’t heard of PewDiePie? And they’re making money doing the thing they love most: gaming. It’s tough to stand out in this crowded niche, but if you can be fresh and different, you could start building your own fan base.</p><p><strong>#3 Food</strong></p><p>If you love to cook (or even just to eat!) food channels can be fab. Showing off recipes is a tried and tested moneymaker, as is showing how to use gadgets and tools in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>#4 Tech review</strong></p><p>We’re all using technology at home, at work, and in our pockets, and want to know that we’re buying the right stuff and using it the right way. People are hungry for this type of content, whether it’s apps and software or physical hardware.</p><p><strong>#5 Travel</strong></p><p>Travel channels have some of the sexiest content on the web, and people love to see what the world is like out there. Invest in a good action camera and find an angle to the places your visit, such as the best places to eat, hidden gems, etc.</p><p><strong>#6 Fashion</strong></p><p>Fashion can be great for YouTube, from reviewing clothing items to keeping your audience updated on the latest trends. It’s a great niche for getting sponsors and earning from affiliate marketing too.</p><p><strong>#7 Sports</strong></p><p>You’ll never run out of content if you’re busy keeping people up to date with their favorite sports teams. Just be careful not to show copyrighted material as you could find your hard work being taken down.</p><p><strong>#8 Animals</strong></p><p>It was cat video’s that birthed the notion of a viral video, and even today hilarious animal clips can garner a huge audience. As well as animals doing funny things, you could also make videos about animal care, training, and reviews of pet products.</p><p><strong>#9 Photography</strong></p><p>Thousands of budding photographers look to YouTube for good advice on how to take better shots. Photography channels can also review equipment and can benefit from affiliate links for these.</p><p><strong>#10 Movies</strong></p><p>If you’re a movie buff, why not take your opinions of the big screen to the small (and often tiny) screen? Post reviews, do top tens, or even create parodies of movies yourself. Just watch out for that copyright issue again.</p><p><strong>#11 How-to tutorials</strong></p><p>Everyone needs to know something in their life, whether it’s how to tie their shoelaces or how to change a spark plug on a car. Answering these ‘how to…’ questions could get you ranking highly and gathering millions of views.</p><p><strong># 12 Music</strong></p><p>You have to be careful when doing a music channel, as you’re unlikely to get permission to play actual tracks. However, you could do commentaries on music news, give advice on instrument care or even teach people how to play. If you’re a musician yourself, this is a great way to get more exposure for your band.</p><p><strong>#13 ASMR</strong></p><p>One of the fastest-growing niches on YouTube, ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response to give it its full name, is all about the experience. Using soothing sounds and imagery to relax viewers, ASMR YouTubers look to create a physical response in the viewer to something happening in the video.</p><p><strong>#14 Lifestyle</strong></p><p>Lifestyle vloggers are those who don’t really fit into a particular niche.

Most of these are from established influencers who have already pretty much cornered the market, so getting a foot in the door as a new YouTuber here is going to be tough. That’s not to say you shouldn’t do it, but you’ll have to work hard to make your channel stand out. Be original, put your own spin on the genre and you’ll get there eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>If you were to start drilling down into that niche, you’ll start to see where the opportunities exist.

Although you’ll find lots of competition here, there is a massive audience too.</p><p><strong>#2 Gaming</strong></p><p>Gaming YouTubers are probably the most well-known; who hasn’t heard of PewDiePie? And they’re making money doing the thing they love most: gaming. It’s tough to stand out in this crowded niche, but if you can be fresh and different, you could start building your own fan base.</p><p><strong>#3 Food</strong></p><p>If you love to cook (or even just to eat!) food channels can be fab. Showing off recipes is a tried and tested moneymaker, as is showing how to use gadgets and tools in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>#4 Tech review</strong></p><p>We’re all using technology at home, at work, and in our pockets, and want to know that we’re buying the right stuff and using it the right way. People are hungry for this type of content, whether it’s apps and software or physical hardware.</p><p><strong>#5 Travel</strong></p><p>Travel channels have some of the sexiest content on the web, and people love to see what the world is like out there. Invest in a good action camera and find an angle to the places your visit, such as the best places to eat, hidden gems, etc.</p><p><strong>#6 Fashion</strong></p><p>Fashion can be great for YouTube, from reviewing clothing items to keeping your audience updated on the latest trends. It’s a great niche for getting sponsors and earning from affiliate marketing too.</p><p><strong>#7 Sports</strong></p><p>You’ll never run out of content if you’re busy keeping people up to date with their favorite sports teams. Just be careful not to show copyrighted material as you could find your hard work being taken down.</p><p><strong>#8 Animals</strong></p><p>It was cat video’s that birthed the notion of a viral video, and even today hilarious animal clips can garner a huge audience.

Photography channels can also review equipment and can benefit from affiliate links for these.</p><p><strong>#10 Movies</strong></p><p>If you’re a movie buff, why not take your opinions of the big screen to the small (and often tiny) screen? Post reviews, do top tens, or even create parodies of movies yourself. Just watch out for that copyright issue again.</p><p><strong>#11 How-to tutorials</strong></p><p>Everyone needs to know something in their life, whether it’s how to tie their shoelaces or how to change a spark plug on a car. Answering these ‘how to…’ questions could get you ranking highly and gathering millions of views.</p><p><strong># 12 Music</strong></p><p>You have to be careful when doing a music channel, as you’re unlikely to get permission to play actual tracks. However, you could do commentaries on music news, give advice on instrument care or even teach people how to play. If you’re a musician yourself, this is a great way to get more exposure for your band.</p><p><strong>#13 ASMR</strong></p><p>One of the fastest-growing niches on YouTube, ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response to give it its full name, is all about the experience. Using soothing sounds and imagery to relax viewers, ASMR YouTubers look to create a physical response in the viewer to something happening in the video.</p><p><strong>#14 Lifestyle</strong></p><p>Lifestyle vloggers are those who don’t really fit into a particular niche.

You could start by listing your hobbies and looking for trends with those, or by thinking about what types of videos you like to make the most. How could what you do for a living inspire your channel or your knowledge of a particular topic?</p><p>The key is to discover where you can bring something unique or interesting to YouTube, hopefully by combining your passions, hobbies, and knowledge into one big ball of brilliance. For example, if you’re keen to do cooking tutorials but spent a year traveling Asia, why not do Asian-inspired cooking? Or if you have a passion for fashion but work as a recruitment consultant, why not offer content about dressing for work and interviews?</p><p>This sweet spot where your passion and talents meet with your video genre is where you’ll find your ultimate niche lurking.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche-3"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?"></a>Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?</h2><p>Finding a niche is all about giving your viewers what they want to see. Imagine you travel and upload vlogs about your travels every day. Almost all of your content is about travel, but then one day, randomly, you upload a video about cooking food. Your video was popular, you got more than 30k views, but only five people subscribed to your channel; why?</p><p>The answer is simple. If those who viewed the cooking video considered subscribing, they would have clicked onto your channel and seen that none of your other videos were about this topic. Despite uploading a good video, you seemed irrelevant to them, so they didn’t bother.</p><p>From the point of view of your subscribers, they want to know what you’re all about. They need to feel confident that, when they subscribe to you, they’ll be getting lots of quality content about the things they are most interested in. Having a clear and focused niche will allow you to do this for them.</p><h2 id="Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche-3"><a href="#Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche-3" class="headerlink" title="Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche"></a>Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche</h2><p>The smaller and more specific your focus, the easier you’ll find it to get and hold onto subscribers. For example, if you’re niche is about dog training, why not focus on even more about doing it about training pugs? If you’re doing a parenting vlog, make it more specific by doing a parenting vlog for mums of boys, or twins, or toddlers.</p><p>By narrowing down your focus, your audience will be much easier to market to and to appeal to. When someone from your target audience finds your channel, they’re going to think ‘wow, this is just what I’ve been looking for’, and they’ll watch, like, share and interact with your videos way more than someone who is just a little bit interested.</p><h2 id="How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips-3"><a href="#How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]"></a>How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]</h2><p>If you’re still at a loss of how to identify the best niche for your YouTube channel, let us help. Here are some key things to think about when looking for your niche which will help you get where you need to be:</p><ul><li><strong>What are you good at? What are you passionate about?</strong></li></ul><p>Make a list of things you’re good at. Don’t be modest now, this isn’t the time. Think about what other people would ask for your help with, and what you’re most confident with. Getting to grips with what you have a talent for is a great place to start.</p><p>An example of this is PONY Syndrome, a makeup artist renowned for her Taylor Swift transformation. She found that people would often come to her for makeup advice, so she started making videos of her techniques. Fast forward a couple of years and she’s got four million subscribers and a profitable YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pony-effect.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You might not think you’re an ‘expert’ in an area, but often it’s the interesting combination of your talents and passions that makes you unique. Coach Tulin is a wonderful lady who is of a plus size but who is also passionate about fitness. She’s made a popular channel that demonstrates how to modify popular exercises to make them accessible for plus-size people, as well as showing just how to fit plus-size people can be! Her fan base is smaller, at 89k subscribers, but she’s still a big influencer in her field.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/coach-tulin.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Subscribers who get help from you are more likely to come back to you time and again. Although we all have a good laugh watching cat videos and other entertaining clips, the YouTube channels that tend to make the most money are those which genuinely help people.</p><ul><li><strong>Is there an audience for your potential niche?</strong></li></ul><p>Once you’ve got an idea about your potential niche, you’ll need to make sure there are actually people out there who want to watch it. To test this out, think about a video you could make for your niche and try looking it up on YouTube. If there are a ton of results, your niche is probably not focused enough. If there are zero results, probably nobody is looking for that type of video.</p><p>You’re looking for somewhere in between the two extremes. If a couple of well-established channels have made a video or two on your topic, but haven’t really focused on it, you can be confident that there is an audience out there but not too much competition. You could also look for something that there are a lot of blog posts or websites about and be the first to migrate the content to YouTube.</p><p>For example, if you were to search ‘makeup tutorial’, you’ll find around 23 million results.

Choosing the right ones at the right moment will help you grow much faster.</p><p>Knowing this, how do you know the perfect hashtags for YouTube?</p><p>The answer is simple. This guide lets you know precisely how to discover the best hashtags for YouTube. In addition, you’ll learn what tools to use and how to always find the correct tag for each video.</p><ol><li><a href="#">Keyword Tool</a></li><li><a href="#">TubeBuddy Chrome Extension</a></li><li><a href="#">VidIQ Chrome Extension</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Bonus: Edit Your Vlog Videos Like A Pro With Filmora</a></li></ul><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags"></a>Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags</h2><p>Hashtags are powerful features that can connect the right viewer to your content.

So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.</p><p>For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.</p><p>This may take a lot of time. However, a YouTube hashtag generator can make this process a lot quicker and even more effective.</p><h2 id="Best-Tools-for-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags"><a href="#Best-Tools-for-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags"></a>Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags</h2><p>You should know that more than these thirty hashtags will be needed to help your videos succeed. But sometimes, you will need better or more appropriate ones.</p><p>The best way to always have the perfect tags is to use a YouTube hashtags generator. It’s a tool that digs up the ideal tags for every type of video.</p><p>Here are the three best YouTube hashtag generators you can use:</p><h3 id="1-Keyword-Tool"><a href="#1-Keyword-Tool" class="headerlink" title="1 Keyword Tool"></a>1 <a class="link"   href="https://keywordtool.io/youtube" >Keyword Tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This tool’s primary purpose may be to help with keyword research, but it has a valuable hashtag extension.</p><p>First, type in the topic of your video. For example, “vlog.” Hit Search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-keyword-tool.jpg"                      alt="youtube hashtag generator"                ></p><p>Then, select the Hashtags panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hashtag-panel.jpg"                      alt="youtube hashtag tool"                ></p><p>This will show you a massive list of trending hashtags you can use for your YouTube video. However, the YouTube tags it gives you will sometimes be different. For example, if you search for the same word at another time, the results may differ depending on current trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-hashtags.jpg"                      alt="list of tags for youtube"                ></p><p>That’s all there is to it. Copy any tags you like and use them for your video. Also, you can purchase the pro version of this tool to get more detailed insights. However, the free version works just fine most of the time. The choice is yours.</p><h3 id="2-TubeBuddy-Chrome-Extension"><a href="#2-TubeBuddy-Chrome-Extension" class="headerlink" title="2 TubeBuddy Chrome Extension"></a>2 <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tubebuddy/mhkhmbddkmdggbhaaaodilponhnccicb" >TubeBuddy Chrome Extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/tubebuddy.jpg"                      alt="tubebuddy chrome extension"                ></p><p>TubeBuddy is a Chrome extension that does much more for your YouTube channel than help with hashtags. It’s an optimization tool that will configure everything for better reach.</p><p>It’s also available as an Android and iOS app. As for the Chrome extension, you install it, and it integrates with YouTube.</p><p>The next time you upload a video, it will analyze it and help you process and publish it more quickly.</p><p>Additionally, TubeBuddy will also show you the best possible hashtags to use for your unique video.

That should be proof enough that this tool truly offers something valuable.</p><h3 id="3-VidIQ-Chrome-Extension"><a href="#3-VidIQ-Chrome-Extension" class="headerlink" title="3 VidIQ Chrome Extension"></a>3 <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vidiq-vision-for-youtube/pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl?hl=en" >VidIQ Chrome Extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/vidlq.jpg"                      alt="vidlq chrome extension"                ></p><p>This is another Chrome extension that helps you find keywords and YouTube tags to get more views.

It’s a tool that digs up the ideal tags for every type of video.</p><p>Here are the three best YouTube hashtag generators you can use:</p><h3 id="1-Keyword-Tool-1"><a href="#1-Keyword-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="1 Keyword Tool"></a>1 <a class="link"   href="https://keywordtool.io/youtube" >Keyword Tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This tool’s primary purpose may be to help with keyword research, but it has a valuable hashtag extension.</p><p>First, type in the topic of your video. For example, “vlog.” Hit Search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-keyword-tool.jpg"                      alt="youtube hashtag generator"                ></p><p>Then, select the Hashtags panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hashtag-panel.jpg"                      alt="youtube hashtag tool"                ></p><p>This will show you a massive list of trending hashtags you can use for your YouTube video. However, the YouTube tags it gives you will sometimes be different. For example, if you search for the same word at another time, the results may differ depending on current trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-hashtags.jpg"                      alt="list of tags for youtube"                ></p><p>That’s all there is to it. Copy any tags you like and use them for your video. Also, you can purchase the pro version of this tool to get more detailed insights. However, the free version works just fine most of the time.

It’s a big world where new things happen every day, in every <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of the best ways to climb to the top of YouTube’s search engine results is to be among the first creators to make a video about a trending topic.</p><p>But how do you know what’s trending? If you’re in a huge genre like beauty or technology then it’s not impossible to keep track of the latest news and trends, but you probably hear about things as other people start making videos and as websites start publishing articles. How do you get on top of trends just as they’re becoming trends?</p><p>Google Trends, of course!</p><p>Google Trends is a completely free tool you can use to determine what’s trending on YouTube or in Google’s search engine. Here’s how you can use Google Trends to figure out what’s trending in your niche and make a video before there’s tons of competition.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture"><a href="#Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture"></a>Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-use-google-trends-to-come-up-with-video-seeing-big-picture.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Ideas"                ></p><p><em>You’ll need to be signed into your Google account to use Google Trends.</em></p><p>Start off at <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" >trends.google.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you’ll see what’s trending in general – usually big news stories or things like sports finals. The data is laid out like this: at the top there are three ‘Featured Insights’. These are three of the most popular trending topics paired with graphs of their recent search traffic. Underneath these there will be a list of stories that are currently trending. You can click on them to see charts of their search data and links to where the stories are being covered online.</p><p>Unless you do news or political commentary on your channel these probably aren’t topics you want to cover, but if you like to insert some topical references into your other videos then it’s still good to be aware of these things.</p><p>To get information more relevant to your channel you’re going to have to do some filtering.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You"><a href="#Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You"></a>Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You</h2><p>In the Google Trend home page, scroll down to the ‘Recently Trending’ section and click on ‘More Trending Searches’.</p><p>Then click from ‘Daily Search Trends’ to ‘Realtime Search Trends’.</p><p>On top you will see two drop-down menus, one is for the category and one is for location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-video-ideas.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Video Ideas"                ></p><p>Under <strong>All categories</strong> select the general theme your channel falls under.</p><p>Your options are business, entertainment, health, Sci&#x2F;Tech, sports, and top stories.</p><p>It might be the case that your channel doesn’t fall under any of these themes, but there could still be related stories for you in other categories. For example, if you have a beauty channel then there could be something that’d interest you under health, entertainment, or even business.</p><p>Under the <strong>location menu</strong> choose the region most of your viewers are from. This might not be the same as where you are from – you could be in Australia and most of your viewers could be in the U.S. If you’re not sure where your viewers are from you can find out in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics &gt; Demographics</strong>.</p><p>Once you have narrowed down your results you can just scroll through and pick out a topic related to your channel’s theme that you have something to say about.</p><p>For example, if you have a gaming channel and you’re looking for a non-gameplay topic to make a video on, you would look under Sci&#x2F;Tech. If I look under that category today (May 29, 2017) and specify that I want topics trending in the United States then these are my top 5 results:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-categories.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Category YouTube Video Ideas"                ></p><p>The first two happen to be about gaming. If you, as a gamer, had any strong reaction to either of these topics – whether it’s that you feel like you’re knowledgeable about them, or that you’re excited by something that’s coming up, or that something made you groan – then that would be a sign that you should make a video. Capitalizing on a trend while also covering a topic you have a lot to say about is always a good move.</p><p>Having something to say doesn’t have to mean having a strong opinion. If you just find something interesting and want to pass the information along to your viewers then that’s great too.</p><p>Clicking on these results will give you more specific data including how often the topic has been searched recently and links to recent news articles. These can give you a better idea of why it is trending and help you come up with what you want to say.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords"><a href="#Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Battle of the Keywords"></a>Part 3: Battle of the Keywords</h2><p>Once you have a topic in mind for your next video – whether it came from Google Trends or your own noggin – think about what the most important keyword for that topic might be.</p><p>A <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-12-step-youtube-seo-guide-for-beginners-who-want-more-448.html" >keyword is a word or short phrase <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that people type into a search engine like Google or YouTube. In order for people to find your videos, you’ll have to include a keyword in your video’s title.</p><p>Once you have a keyword in mind, type it into the Explore bar at the top of your page in Google Trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/explore-topic-in-google-trends.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Keywords YouTube Video"                ></p><p>What happens after you click <strong>enter</strong> is pretty much magic. Say I want to make a video on how to use Filmora. The first thing I’ll type into that Explore bar is ‘Filmora’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Keywords"                ></p><p>You can see near the top that this chart represents searches for the topic over the last 5 years, which isn’t necessarily useful (although it is sort of cool that you can see when Filmora was ‘born’). I’m going to narrow that down to results from the U.S in the last week.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-time-range.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Ideas Filmora"                ></p><p>There, now I can see how the popularity of Filmora as a search term has spiked on specific days and times (if you hover over a spike it tells you the time and day) and plan to post my video at a time that capitalizes on these trends.</p><p>Next, what other words do I want to include in my video title? Is this a review, a tutorial, or a how-to? By clicking on my search term Filmora, I can edit it to read ‘filmora review’. Then I can click <strong>+ Compare</strong> and type in ‘filmora tutorial’ and ‘how to use Filmora’. Google Trends will create a chart comparing the popularity of those 3 terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-comparison.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Filmora Keywords"                ></p><p><em>I also ‘zoomed out’ to 90 days – if I’d only looked at how they compared over the last week my results could have been skewed.</em></p><p>It’s pretty clear from the chart that ‘filmora review’ is the strongest of those 3 search terms. The title of my video should definitely start with the words <strong>Filmora Review</strong> because that is what most people are searching for when they want information about Filmora. Putting your most important keyword&#x2F;search term first in your video titles will help them rank better in the viewer’s search results.</p><p>Although, when you do a comparison like this you should also go to YouTube and search for each potential keyword&#x2F;phrase individually. It might turn out that there is a ton of strong competition for the most popular search term, and not as much for the second or third most popular. Here’s a search for ‘Filmora Review’ on YouTube:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-youtube-keyword-search.jpg"                      alt="YouTube search Filmora Keyword"                ></p><p><em>If my view of YouTube looks different from yours it’s because I’m using the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vidiq-vision-for-youtube/pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl?hl=en" >VidIQ plugin for Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free and it gives you all kinds of extra info about videos and channels.</em></p><p>The second-highest ranked result is only 2 months old and isn’t from a huge channel. Although there is competition for this keyword, ranking for it is not impossible.

For example, if you have a beauty channel then there could be something that’d interest you under health, entertainment, or even business.</p><p>Under the <strong>location menu</strong> choose the region most of your viewers are from. This might not be the same as where you are from – you could be in Australia and most of your viewers could be in the U.S. If you’re not sure where your viewers are from you can find out in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics &gt; Demographics</strong>.</p><p>Once you have narrowed down your results you can just scroll through and pick out a topic related to your channel’s theme that you have something to say about.</p><p>For example, if you have a gaming channel and you’re looking for a non-gameplay topic to make a video on, you would look under Sci&#x2F;Tech. If I look under that category today (May 29, 2017) and specify that I want topics trending in the United States then these are my top 5 results:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-categories.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Category YouTube Video Ideas"                ></p><p>The first two happen to be about gaming.

Capitalizing on a trend while also covering a topic you have a lot to say about is always a good move.</p><p>Having something to say doesn’t have to mean having a strong opinion. If you just find something interesting and want to pass the information along to your viewers then that’s great too.</p><p>Clicking on these results will give you more specific data including how often the topic has been searched recently and links to recent news articles. These can give you a better idea of why it is trending and help you come up with what you want to say.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords-1"><a href="#Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Battle of the Keywords"></a>Part 3: Battle of the Keywords</h2><p>Once you have a topic in mind for your next video – whether it came from Google Trends or your own noggin – think about what the most important keyword for that topic might be.</p><p>A <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-12-step-youtube-seo-guide-for-beginners-who-want-more-448.html" >keyword is a word or short phrase <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that people type into a search engine like Google or YouTube. In order for people to find your videos, you’ll have to include a keyword in your video’s title.</p><p>Once you have a keyword in mind, type it into the Explore bar at the top of your page in Google Trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/explore-topic-in-google-trends.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Keywords YouTube Video"                ></p><p>What happens after you click <strong>enter</strong> is pretty much magic. Say I want to make a video on how to use Filmora. The first thing I’ll type into that Explore bar is ‘Filmora’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Keywords"                ></p><p>You can see near the top that this chart represents searches for the topic over the last 5 years, which isn’t necessarily useful (although it is sort of cool that you can see when Filmora was ‘born’). I’m going to narrow that down to results from the U.S in the last week.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-time-range.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Ideas Filmora"                ></p><p>There, now I can see how the popularity of Filmora as a search term has spiked on specific days and times (if you hover over a spike it tells you the time and day) and plan to post my video at a time that capitalizes on these trends.</p><p>Next, what other words do I want to include in my video title? Is this a review, a tutorial, or a how-to? By clicking on my search term Filmora, I can edit it to read ‘filmora review’. Then I can click <strong>+ Compare</strong> and type in ‘filmora tutorial’ and ‘how to use Filmora’. Google Trends will create a chart comparing the popularity of those 3 terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-comparison.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Filmora Keywords"                ></p><p><em>I also ‘zoomed out’ to 90 days – if I’d only looked at how they compared over the last week my results could have been skewed.</em></p><p>It’s pretty clear from the chart that ‘filmora review’ is the strongest of those 3 search terms. The title of my video should definitely start with the words <strong>Filmora Review</strong> because that is what most people are searching for when they want information about Filmora. Putting your most important keyword&#x2F;search term first in your video titles will help them rank better in the viewer’s search results.</p><p>Although, when you do a comparison like this you should also go to YouTube and search for each potential keyword&#x2F;phrase individually. It might turn out that there is a ton of strong competition for the most popular search term, and not as much for the second or third most popular. Here’s a search for ‘Filmora Review’ on YouTube:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-youtube-keyword-search.jpg"                      alt="YouTube search Filmora Keyword"                ></p><p><em>If my view of YouTube looks different from yours it’s because I’m using the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vidiq-vision-for-youtube/pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl?hl=en" >VidIQ plugin for Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

The first thing I’ll type into that Explore bar is ‘Filmora’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Keywords"                ></p><p>You can see near the top that this chart represents searches for the topic over the last 5 years, which isn’t necessarily useful (although it is sort of cool that you can see when Filmora was ‘born’). I’m going to narrow that down to results from the U.S in the last week.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-time-range.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Ideas Filmora"                ></p><p>There, now I can see how the popularity of Filmora as a search term has spiked on specific days and times (if you hover over a spike it tells you the time and day) and plan to post my video at a time that capitalizes on these trends.</p><p>Next, what other words do I want to include in my video title? Is this a review, a tutorial, or a how-to? By clicking on my search term Filmora, I can edit it to read ‘filmora review’. Then I can click <strong>+ Compare</strong> and type in ‘filmora tutorial’ and ‘how to use Filmora’. Google Trends will create a chart comparing the popularity of those 3 terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-comparison.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Filmora Keywords"                ></p><p><em>I also ‘zoomed out’ to 90 days – if I’d only looked at how they compared over the last week my results could have been skewed.</em></p><p>It’s pretty clear from the chart that ‘filmora review’ is the strongest of those 3 search terms. The title of my video should definitely start with the words <strong>Filmora Review</strong> because that is what most people are searching for when they want information about Filmora. Putting your most important keyword&#x2F;search term first in your video titles will help them rank better in the viewer’s search results.</p><p>Although, when you do a comparison like this you should also go to YouTube and search for each potential keyword&#x2F;phrase individually. It might turn out that there is a ton of strong competition for the most popular search term, and not as much for the second or third most popular. Here’s a search for ‘Filmora Review’ on YouTube:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-youtube-keyword-search.jpg"                      alt="YouTube search Filmora Keyword"                ></p><p><em>If my view of YouTube looks different from yours it’s because I’m using the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vidiq-vision-for-youtube/pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl?hl=en" >VidIQ plugin for Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

It also helps that software reviews are a topic where people will always be looking for the latest information&#x2F;newest videos.</p><p>If the search results for your keyword are dominated by monster channels with millions of subs, and you can’t think of an angle you can use to crack into those top results (i.e. having newer information people will be looking for, which the more established videos are lacking), then maybe try the search with your second best keyword and see if there’s a better opportunity for you to rank there.</p><p>One of the biggest benefits of identifying trends and making videos about them quickly is that you can get in before there’s a lot of competition for the first few pages of search results on YouTube or Google, and before larger channels start making videos of their own on the same topic.</p><p>Want to make coming up with YouTube video ideas a habit? <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-come-up-with-better-youtube-video-ideas-391.html" >This post here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will help you develop a process to generate more ideas and properly evaluate them.</p><h2 id="Making-Better-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora-2"><a href="#Making-Better-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="Making Better YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Making Better YouTube Videos with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>As one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers, Filmora provides plentiful editing tools, such as cut, trim, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video stabilization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >noise removal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >chroma key compositing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and color grading.

It’s a big world where new things happen every day, in every <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of the best ways to climb to the top of YouTube’s search engine results is to be among the first creators to make a video about a trending topic.</p><p>But how do you know what’s trending? If you’re in a huge genre like beauty or technology then it’s not impossible to keep track of the latest news and trends, but you probably hear about things as other people start making videos and as websites start publishing articles. How do you get on top of trends just as they’re becoming trends?</p><p>Google Trends, of course!</p><p>Google Trends is a completely free tool you can use to determine what’s trending on YouTube or in Google’s search engine. Here’s how you can use Google Trends to figure out what’s trending in your niche and make a video before there’s tons of competition.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture-3"><a href="#Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture"></a>Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-use-google-trends-to-come-up-with-video-seeing-big-picture.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Ideas"                ></p><p><em>You’ll need to be signed into your Google account to use Google Trends.</em></p><p>Start off at <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" >trends.google.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you’ll see what’s trending in general – usually big news stories or things like sports finals. The data is laid out like this: at the top there are three ‘Featured Insights’. These are three of the most popular trending topics paired with graphs of their recent search traffic. Underneath these there will be a list of stories that are currently trending. You can click on them to see charts of their search data and links to where the stories are being covered online.</p><p>Unless you do news or political commentary on your channel these probably aren’t topics you want to cover, but if you like to insert some topical references into your other videos then it’s still good to be aware of these things.</p><p>To get information more relevant to your channel you’re going to have to do some filtering.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You-3"><a href="#Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You"></a>Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You</h2><p>In the Google Trend home page, scroll down to the ‘Recently Trending’ section and click on ‘More Trending Searches’.</p><p>Then click from ‘Daily Search Trends’ to ‘Realtime Search Trends’.</p><p>On top you will see two drop-down menus, one is for the category and one is for location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-video-ideas.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Video Ideas"                ></p><p>Under <strong>All categories</strong> select the general theme your channel falls under.</p><p>Your options are business, entertainment, health, Sci&#x2F;Tech, sports, and top stories.</p><p>It might be the case that your channel doesn’t fall under any of these themes, but there could still be related stories for you in other categories. For example, if you have a beauty channel then there could be something that’d interest you under health, entertainment, or even business.</p><p>Under the <strong>location menu</strong> choose the region most of your viewers are from. This might not be the same as where you are from – you could be in Australia and most of your viewers could be in the U.S. If you’re not sure where your viewers are from you can find out in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics &gt; Demographics</strong>.</p><p>Once you have narrowed down your results you can just scroll through and pick out a topic related to your channel’s theme that you have something to say about.</p><p>For example, if you have a gaming channel and you’re looking for a non-gameplay topic to make a video on, you would look under Sci&#x2F;Tech. If I look under that category today (May 29, 2017) and specify that I want topics trending in the United States then these are my top 5 results:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-categories.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Category YouTube Video Ideas"                ></p><p>The first two happen to be about gaming. If you, as a gamer, had any strong reaction to either of these topics – whether it’s that you feel like you’re knowledgeable about them, or that you’re excited by something that’s coming up, or that something made you groan – then that would be a sign that you should make a video. Capitalizing on a trend while also covering a topic you have a lot to say about is always a good move.</p><p>Having something to say doesn’t have to mean having a strong opinion. If you just find something interesting and want to pass the information along to your viewers then that’s great too.</p><p>Clicking on these results will give you more specific data including how often the topic has been searched recently and links to recent news articles. These can give you a better idea of why it is trending and help you come up with what you want to say.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords-3"><a href="#Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Battle of the Keywords"></a>Part 3: Battle of the Keywords</h2><p>Once you have a topic in mind for your next video – whether it came from Google Trends or your own noggin – think about what the most important keyword for that topic might be.</p><p>A <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-12-step-youtube-seo-guide-for-beginners-who-want-more-448.html" >keyword is a word or short phrase <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that people type into a search engine like Google or YouTube.

However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p><p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p><p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p><p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p><p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram"></a>1. Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram</h4><p>Images and one-minute long videos can engage with your users, help them work up an appetite for your videos, and direct them to your YouTube channel for more.</p><p>The great thing about Instagram — compared to YouTube — is that it’s easier to produce content for Instagram every day without exhausting your resources.</p><p>Be thinking about what you can post on to Instagram while you work on your YouTube video. You want a really attractive image or short video, which can be something you capture as you work on your long-form video: short preview or behind the scenes footage.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-Share-Your-Life"><a href="#2-Share-Your-Life" class="headerlink" title="2. Share Your Life"></a>2. Share Your Life</h4><p>Instagram allows you to consistently post content from your life. This allows you to connect with your audience as they discover more about you, so when it comes time for the YouTube video, they feel that have an established relationship with you.</p><p>They see your picture or video on their feed every day after all. You and your followers are practically friends.</p><p>While Instagram has multiple ways you can post onto the platform, we will talk about two very different strategies:</p><h3 id="How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed"><a href="#How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed" class="headerlink" title="How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed"></a>How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed</h3><p>When you post an image or a video onto Instagram directly it will be on your timeline and acts as a tile for your whole Instagram feed page. This piece of content will stay on your page forever, or until you delete it.</p><p>Like your YouTube videos, the content you post to your Instagram directly should have a cohesive theme that matches your branding. Keep an eye on your: -</p><p>- Aesthetic</p><p>- Caption</p><p>- Filter</p><p>As Instagram has grown in popularity, a lot of tools have been developed to help creators like yourself. Here are a few apps that you can include in your kit:</p><p>- <a href="https://vsco.co/"><strong>VSCO</strong></a>: A photo editor app that will allow you to clean up and enhance details to really make your visuals pop.</p><p>- <a href="https://unum.la/"><strong>UNUM</strong></a>: An Instagram planner app that enables you to visualize and pre-plan your post.</p><p>- <a href="https://later.com/"><strong>Later</strong></a>: A scheduling tool you can use to auto-publish to directly to Instagram.</p><p>- <a href="https://www.planoly.com/"><strong>Planoly</strong></a>: Drag and drop scheduler and planner, allows you to see the whole grid before posting.</p><p>Here’s Liza Koshy’s Instagram feed. As you can see, she has a clear style and also a variety of content. If you haven’t heard of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/lizakoshy/" >Liza Koshy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and found her through Instagram, you get curious: “What does she do?” Instagram is fantastic for building intrigue and garnering interest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-feed-liza-koshy.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Feed sample"                ><em>Instagram: Liza Koshy</em></p><p>This will be a good place to post a teaser of your latest video, upload an inspiring image, or share an interesting piece of content that shows the world what you are all about.</p><p>Have a different type of content lined up. You don’t want someone to end up on your Instagram page and only see selfies or inspiring quotes.</p><p>You won’t know which type of content will hook your next fan… so experiment.</p><p>When you post onto Instagram directly, you can’t add a are unable to link in the caption. This has been a bane for marketers and creators since the beginning of Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-feed-2.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Feed sample 2"                ></p><p><em>Instagram: Pointless Blog</em></p><p>While Instagram is a great engagement platform, it hasn’t been the best channel for those who want to have a direct call to action. The old method was to direct the viewer to your Instagram bio where there is the only place to post a link.</p><p>However, once you’ve gained a large following (10K) you will be able to <a class="link"   href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-add-a-link-to-your-instagram-stories/" >attached links <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Instagram Story.</p><h3 id="2-How-YouTubers-Should-on-Post-Instagram-Story"><a href="#2-How-YouTubers-Should-on-Post-Instagram-Story" class="headerlink" title="2. How YouTubers Should on Post Instagram Story "></a>2. How YouTubers Should on Post Instagram Story </h3 ></h3><p>Instagram Story allows you to post a series of images and videos over the course of 24 hours. After that, the collection of content — or “story” — from that day disappears.</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-want-your-Instagram-Story-to-disappear-forever"><a href="#1-Don’t-want-your-Instagram-Story-to-disappear-forever" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t want your Instagram Story to disappear forever?"></a>1. Don’t want your Instagram Story to disappear forever?</h4><p>There is a feature called “Highlight” which archives your stories so that you can view them later, however, they will be kept on your Instagram profile page. This allows visitors to see your best stories and have prepared content even when you go 24 hours without posting something new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-feed-3.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Feed sample 3"                ><em>Instagram: Marianna Hewitt</em></p><h4 id="2-Use-Instagram-Story-to-Make-an-Announcement"><a href="#2-Use-Instagram-Story-to-Make-an-Announcement" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Instagram Story to Make an Announcement"></a>2. Use Instagram Story to Make an Announcement</h4><p>While you are uploading your latest video to YouTube, go on Instagram Story and let your followers know.</p><p>Unlike posting directly to the Instagram timeline, once you reach a certain milestone, Instagram Story allows you to create a link right in the content. The ability to offer something timely and encourage the viewer to swipe up is a fantastic way to catch your audience when they are most interested in your content. By doing so, you redirect them from Instagram to your YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-feed-4.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Feed sample 4"                ></p><p><em>Instagram: Jenn Im</em></p><p>Don’t think of Instagram Story as simply a mean for promoting your video, but a chance to give your loyal viewers an exclusive view into your process, allow them to get familiar with your personality and increase the exposure of your brand as a whole, solidifying your relationship.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Facebook-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-2-Facebook-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Facebook for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 2: Facebook for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Facebook is the world’s most popular social media platform. With that claim, it can help any new YouTuber find and grow their audience. It doesn’t matter if their channel is about fashion or karate, Facebook is an appropriate platform for interacting with the audience, as long as the content you share is relevant and click-worthy.</p><p>There are a number of ways to share content on Facebook:</p><p>- Sharing on your own personal timeline allows your Friends to see the content.</p><p>- Sharing directly to a particular group or person’s feed assures those in the group or that specific person will see the content.</p><p>- Sharing via a separate Page you’ve built for your YouTube channel allows those who are following the page to see the content.</p><h4 id="1-Improve-YouTube-Video-Thumbnail-on-Facebook"><a href="#1-Improve-YouTube-Video-Thumbnail-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="1. Improve YouTube Video Thumbnail on Facebook"></a>1. Improve YouTube Video Thumbnail on Facebook</h4><p>Facebook doesn’t make it easy for YouTubers to show their video on Facebook’s news feed, especially if it is hosted on YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-youtube-on-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="share YouTube video on Facebook"                ></p><p>When you post your video from YouTube directly to Facebook, it’ll look something like the image above. Unremarkable. While your audience can still view the video on the Facebook timeline, your fans scrolling by wouldn’t even notice it.</p><p>This is Facebook’s way of encouraging you to post videos directly to Facebook’s platform. Which is something you should consider as well, but as you are currently working to grow your YouTube channel, it’s good to focus on this task first.</p><p>Well, how do you make the post look better? There is a tool called<a class="link"   href="https://thumbtube.com/" >Thumb Tube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that gives you full sized image on Facebook:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-youtube-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Share YouTube on Facebook 2"                ></p><p>Thumb Tube takes your YouTube video link and redirects it so it is now hosted on ThumbTube.com. Yet, anyone viewing the video there is watching on YouTube, not Facebook. This allows you to still capture all the views, likes, and comments on YouTube.</p><h3 id="1-Managing-a-Facebook-Page-for-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#1-Managing-a-Facebook-Page-for-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1. Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel"></a>1. Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel</h3><p>Know this, Facebook has been around for over a decade, and establishing yourself on the social network in 2018 is not what it was like in the late ‘00s. Hard truths: building a following from scratch is going to be a lot of work.</p><h4 id="1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard"><a href="#1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard" class="headerlink" title="1. Growing on Facebook is Hard"></a>1. Growing on Facebook is Hard</h4><p>Before you go and start committing yourself to Facebook, consider your capacity and your audience: are you able to dedicate time and effort on Facebook? Is this the best platform to reach your viewers?</p><p>So Facebook is for you. How should you approach it?</p><h4 id="2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p><ol><li>Click “Create Pages”</li><li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-page.jpg"                      alt="create facebook page"                ></p><ol><li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li><li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-page-settings.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Page settings"                ></li><li>INVITE!</li></ol><p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin. If YouTube is your priority, all other social media communities should be complementary, not an obligation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Twitter-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-3-Twitter-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Twitter for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 3: Twitter for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Unlike Facebook or Instagram, Twitter is a platform where you must be ready with a large amount of valuable content to share, otherwise, you will be lost in the noise. Don’t be afraid to tweet similar content throughout a day. As long as it is done well and isn’t misleading viewers, it wouldn’t be considered spam.</p><p>Twitter allows you to get in front of some of the most influential people on the Internet and stay on top of global trends. It is not always easy to get noticed on Twitter, but when your content really resonates, it’s also hard to be ignored.</p><h4 id="1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1.

If you are talking about something that nobody is interested in, you might not be heard at all. Keep an eye on the most popular hashtags for that day and get involved with a conversation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-advantage-of-trending-hashtags.jpg"                      alt="take advantage of Twitter hashtag"                ></p><p>While you should definitely tweet and gain engagement for your YouTube videos, you will also need to tweet out other content.</p><p>Constantly keeping an eye on what the world is talking about gives you an idea of what is important to discuss. This may even help guide your next YouTube video.</p><h4 id="2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers"><a href="#2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="2. Tag Brands and Influencers"></a>2. Tag Brands and Influencers</h4><p>Twitter is a great platform if your channel showcases brands, personalities, or influencers because it gives you the ability to get in front of them. Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p><p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tag-brand-influencer-twitter.jpg"                      alt="Tag brand and influencer"                ></p><p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p><p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p><p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p><p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Reddit for YouTube creators can be an intimidating place. Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p><p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p><p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p><h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="1.

Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit</h4><p>If you can tap into the community values of Reddit, contribute to conversations and share interesting and relevant content there might not be a better platform to grow your YouTube audience.</p><p>Many media organizations with a significant following are starting to <a class="link"   href="https://medium.com/@davelee/a-journalists-guide-to-reddit-your-newest-super-source-fa250e967b97" >use Reddit to find stories and viral content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Don’t Promote Yourself"></a>2. Don’t Promote Yourself</h4><p>Reddit is not a platform where you enter, drop your content in, and expect people to engage with it. For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p><p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p><h4 id="3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes"><a href="#3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes" class="headerlink" title="3.

Be sure to read these rules before posting onto these specific communities. Understanding these rules will help you understand the purpose of this community.</p><p>Here is an example of reddiquettes for r&#x2F;Cameras:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reddit-community-guideline-sample.jpg"                      alt="reddit community guideline sample"                ></p><p>You only have so many strikes with Reddit before your account gets banned. But don’t worry about all that. Be your awesome self.</p><p>When you are on Reddit, don’t think of yourself as a YouTuber, think of yourself as a redditor, if you do, you’ll have a bright future on the platform.</p><h4 id="4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely"><a href="#4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely" class="headerlink" title="4.

Then again, you’ll never know.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>If your audience craves immediacy and exclusivity, then Snapchat is definitely the social media channel that you’d want to explore.</p><p>The ephemeral nature of Snapchat makes it a unique way of marketing your content as what you snap will only be available within 24 hours. Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism"></a>1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism</h4><p>Snapchat is young, fun, and silly. On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p><p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote-account-to-get-views.jpg"                      alt="promote account to get views"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Markiplier tweeting his Snapchat username.</em></p><p>Here are a few quick tips for promoting your Snapchat account.</p><p>- Make sure your Snapchat handle is present on your YouTube channel and other social media platforms.</p><p>- Make your<a class="link"   href="https://blackatlascreative.com/blog/how-do-snapchats-snapcodes-work/" >Snapchat snapcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>your profile pic, so people can scan and connect with you.</p><p>- Get other Snapchatters to give you a shout-out on their account.</p><p>Marketing on social media is essential for not only growing your YouTube channel but your entire brand.

However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p><p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p><p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p><p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p><p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-1"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel</h3><p>Know this, Facebook has been around for over a decade, and establishing yourself on the social network in 2018 is not what it was like in the late ‘00s.

Growing on Facebook is Hard"></a>1. Growing on Facebook is Hard</h4><p>Before you go and start committing yourself to Facebook, consider your capacity and your audience: are you able to dedicate time and effort on Facebook? Is this the best platform to reach your viewers?</p><p>So Facebook is for you. How should you approach it?</p><h4 id="2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-1"><a href="#2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p><ol><li>Click “Create Pages”</li><li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-page.jpg"                      alt="create facebook page"                ></p><ol><li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li><li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-page-settings.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Page settings"                ></li><li>INVITE!</li></ol><p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-1"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin.

Don’t be afraid to tweet similar content throughout a day. As long as it is done well and isn’t misleading viewers, it wouldn’t be considered spam.</p><p>Twitter allows you to get in front of some of the most influential people on the Internet and stay on top of global trends. It is not always easy to get noticed on Twitter, but when your content really resonates, it’s also hard to be ignored.</p><h4 id="1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags-1"><a href="#1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Tag Brands and Influencers</h4><p>Twitter is a great platform if your channel showcases brands, personalities, or influencers because it gives you the ability to get in front of them. Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p><p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tag-brand-influencer-twitter.jpg"                      alt="Tag brand and influencer"                ></p><p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p><p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p><p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p><p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1"><a href="#Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Reddit for YouTube creators can be an intimidating place. Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p><p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p><p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p><h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-1"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p><p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p><h4 id="3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes-1"><a href="#3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-1"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p><p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote-account-to-get-views.jpg"                      alt="promote account to get views"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Markiplier tweeting his Snapchat username.</em></p><p>Here are a few quick tips for promoting your Snapchat account.</p><p>- Make sure your Snapchat handle is present on your YouTube channel and other social media platforms.</p><p>- Make your<a class="link"   href="https://blackatlascreative.com/blog/how-do-snapchats-snapcodes-work/" >Snapchat snapcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>your profile pic, so people can scan and connect with you.</p><p>- Get other Snapchatters to give you a shout-out on their account.</p><p>Marketing on social media is essential for not only growing your YouTube channel but your entire brand.

However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p><p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p><p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p><p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p><p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-2"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-2"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p><ol><li>Click “Create Pages”</li><li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-page.jpg"                      alt="create facebook page"                ></p><ol><li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li><li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-page-settings.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Page settings"                ></li><li>INVITE!</li></ol><p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-2"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin.

Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p><p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tag-brand-influencer-twitter.jpg"                      alt="Tag brand and influencer"                ></p><p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p><p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p><p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p><p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss.

That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content.

Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat.

Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat.

However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p><p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p><p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p><p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p><p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-3"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram</h4><p>Images and one-minute long videos can engage with your users, help them work up an appetite for your videos, and direct them to your YouTube channel for more.</p><p>The great thing about Instagram — compared to YouTube — is that it’s easier to produce content for Instagram every day without exhausting your resources.</p><p>Be thinking about what you can post on to Instagram while you work on your YouTube video. You want a really attractive image or short video, which can be something you capture as you work on your long-form video: short preview or behind the scenes footage.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-Share-Your-Life-3"><a href="#2-Share-Your-Life-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

This allows you to connect with your audience as they discover more about you, so when it comes time for the YouTube video, they feel that have an established relationship with you.</p><p>They see your picture or video on their feed every day after all. You and your followers are practically friends.</p><p>While Instagram has multiple ways you can post onto the platform, we will talk about two very different strategies:</p><h3 id="How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed-3"><a href="#How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed-3" class="headerlink" title="How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed"></a>How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed</h3><p>When you post an image or a video onto Instagram directly it will be on your timeline and acts as a tile for your whole Instagram feed page. This piece of content will stay on your page forever, or until you delete it.</p><p>Like your YouTube videos, the content you post to your Instagram directly should have a cohesive theme that matches your branding. Keep an eye on your: -</p><p>- Aesthetic</p><p>- Caption</p><p>- Filter</p><p>As Instagram has grown in popularity, a lot of tools have been developed to help creators like yourself.

You don’t want someone to end up on your Instagram page and only see selfies or inspiring quotes.</p><p>You won’t know which type of content will hook your next fan… so experiment.</p><p>When you post onto Instagram directly, you can’t add a are unable to link in the caption.

Use Instagram Story to Make an Announcement</h4><p>While you are uploading your latest video to YouTube, go on Instagram Story and let your followers know.</p><p>Unlike posting directly to the Instagram timeline, once you reach a certain milestone, Instagram Story allows you to create a link right in the content. The ability to offer something timely and encourage the viewer to swipe up is a fantastic way to catch your audience when they are most interested in your content. By doing so, you redirect them from Instagram to your YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-feed-4.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Feed sample 4"                ></p><p><em>Instagram: Jenn Im</em></p><p>Don’t think of Instagram Story as simply a mean for promoting your video, but a chance to give your loyal viewers an exclusive view into your process, allow them to get familiar with your personality and increase the exposure of your brand as a whole, solidifying your relationship.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Facebook-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3"><a href="#Part-2-Facebook-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Facebook for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 2: Facebook for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Facebook is the world’s most popular social media platform. With that claim, it can help any new YouTuber find and grow their audience. It doesn’t matter if their channel is about fashion or karate, Facebook is an appropriate platform for interacting with the audience, as long as the content you share is relevant and click-worthy.</p><p>There are a number of ways to share content on Facebook:</p><p>- Sharing on your own personal timeline allows your Friends to see the content.</p><p>- Sharing directly to a particular group or person’s feed assures those in the group or that specific person will see the content.</p><p>- Sharing via a separate Page you’ve built for your YouTube channel allows those who are following the page to see the content.</p><h4 id="1-Improve-YouTube-Video-Thumbnail-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#1-Improve-YouTube-Video-Thumbnail-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Unremarkable. While your audience can still view the video on the Facebook timeline, your fans scrolling by wouldn’t even notice it.</p><p>This is Facebook’s way of encouraging you to post videos directly to Facebook’s platform. Which is something you should consider as well, but as you are currently working to grow your YouTube channel, it’s good to focus on this task first.</p><p>Well, how do you make the post look better? There is a tool called<a class="link"   href="https://thumbtube.com/" >Thumb Tube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that gives you full sized image on Facebook:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-youtube-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Share YouTube on Facebook 2"                ></p><p>Thumb Tube takes your YouTube video link and redirects it so it is now hosted on ThumbTube.com.

Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel</h3><p>Know this, Facebook has been around for over a decade, and establishing yourself on the social network in 2018 is not what it was like in the late ‘00s.

Growing on Facebook is Hard"></a>1. Growing on Facebook is Hard</h4><p>Before you go and start committing yourself to Facebook, consider your capacity and your audience: are you able to dedicate time and effort on Facebook? Is this the best platform to reach your viewers?</p><p>So Facebook is for you. How should you approach it?</p><h4 id="2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-3"><a href="#2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p><ol><li>Click “Create Pages”</li><li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-page.jpg"                      alt="create facebook page"                ></p><ol><li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li><li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-page-settings.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Page settings"                ></li><li>INVITE!</li></ol><p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-3"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin.

Don’t be afraid to tweet similar content throughout a day. As long as it is done well and isn’t misleading viewers, it wouldn’t be considered spam.</p><p>Twitter allows you to get in front of some of the most influential people on the Internet and stay on top of global trends. It is not always easy to get noticed on Twitter, but when your content really resonates, it’s also hard to be ignored.</p><h4 id="1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags-3"><a href="#1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Tag Brands and Influencers</h4><p>Twitter is a great platform if your channel showcases brands, personalities, or influencers because it gives you the ability to get in front of them. Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p><p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tag-brand-influencer-twitter.jpg"                      alt="Tag brand and influencer"                ></p><p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p><p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p><p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p><p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3"><a href="#Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Reddit for YouTube creators can be an intimidating place. Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p><p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p><p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p><h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-3"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p><p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p><h4 id="3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes-3"><a href="#3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely</h4><p>While there are some subreddits that demand relevant content, some subreddits will allow you post your videos as long as 90% of your content are from another source aside from your YouTube channel, you won’t be considered spammy.</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YouTuber</strong>: Get critiques for your videos</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;Videos</strong>: Post any video into the masses</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YTPL</strong>: Share a whole playlist</p><p>Because these subreddits are unfocused and loaded with a variety of content, it’s often tricky to find your specific audience there. Then again, you’ll never know.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3"><a href="#Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>If your audience craves immediacy and exclusivity, then Snapchat is definitely the social media channel that you’d want to explore.</p><p>The ephemeral nature of Snapchat makes it a unique way of marketing your content as what you snap will only be available within 24 hours. Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-3"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism"></a>1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism</h4><p>Snapchat is young, fun, and silly. On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p><p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote-account-to-get-views.jpg"                      alt="promote account to get views"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Markiplier tweeting his Snapchat username.</em></p><p>Here are a few quick tips for promoting your Snapchat account.</p><p>- Make sure your Snapchat handle is present on your YouTube channel and other social media platforms.</p><p>- Make your<a class="link"   href="https://blackatlascreative.com/blog/how-do-snapchats-snapcodes-work/" >Snapchat snapcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>your profile pic, so people can scan and connect with you.</p><p>- Get other Snapchatters to give you a shout-out on their account.</p><p>Marketing on social media is essential for not only growing your YouTube channel but your entire brand.

And the green screen is one common practice. Green screen technology is a technique where you use two images or video streams to composite them together. You can use any background images, either foreground or behind the actors. For YouTube, you can use green screen subscribe to facilitate video Call To Action. A green screen easily produces impossible scenes and expands filming ideas. Everything done at the Studio is also the best way to protect actors from hazardous environments.</p><p>More so, the best trick is to allow actors to appear together on the screen even when the scenes were captured separately. And did you know that subscribe green screen makes it easy to add YouTube Call To Action and direct viewers on what to do?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-1.png"                      alt="subscribe green screen"                ></p><h2 id="Methods-to-add-a-subscribe-button-to-your-video"><a href="#Methods-to-add-a-subscribe-button-to-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Methods to add a subscribe button to your video"></a>Methods to add a subscribe button to your video</h2><p>Viewers are not likely to subscribe to any channel if they are not guided. One best method is to engage a subscribe button to your video and draw the attention of as many as possible.</p><h4 id="1-Use-Subscribe-Green-Screen"><a href="#1-Use-Subscribe-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="1 Use Subscribe Green Screen"></a>1 Use Subscribe Green Screen</h4><p>Put your green screen to work by subscribing to it. Follow these steps to produce eye-catching videos, with a call to action closing point.</p><p><strong>Step 1. Set screen</strong><br>You need to create a background at the Studio – and that’s the green screen. Keenly hand it on a frame before you start filming. Also, note that no wrinkles or fold-ups are visible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-2.png"                      alt="how to make subscribe green screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Adjust lighting</strong><br>Lighting is important to facilitate high-resolution video output quality. Put appropriate lighting settings to avoid directional shadows and get the best results.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Set up the subject</strong><br>Give ample space between the subject and the green screen for an effective outcome. If they are too close, there will be a reflection of the green screen on the subject. It isn’t professional as it will be hard when it comes to matching to a different background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-3.png"                      alt="make your own green screen - set up the object"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4. Start filming</strong><br>Begin to film your video and ensure you take various shots for comparison. It is good to film at different angles to see what works best.</p><p><strong>Step 5. Polish the rough cut</strong><br>Tune all the footage to perfect video clips. It will save your efforts when keying out green screen footage. Remove the unwanted parts by trimming. You can also do other edits like merge and split where necessary.</p><p><strong>Step 6. Key out the footage and edit the green screen</strong><br>Your footage is now ready, and you are now free to edit the green screen. It is better to engage reliable editing software to remove the green traces in the shot.</p><p><strong>Step 7. Paste the new background</strong><br>Any background concept can now fit in. Add your desired background video or image in a new layer below the subject. You can continue to make other necessary adjustments like sharpness and hue for reality.</p><p><strong>Step 8. Add Call To Action</strong><br>Finally, tell your viewers to subscribe to your YouTube channel while watching the video. You can also introduce your other channels that aren’t yet known or those that have not reached 1,000 subscribers.</p><h4 id="2-Using-YouTube-Studio"><a href="#2-Using-YouTube-Studio" class="headerlink" title="2 Using YouTube Studio"></a>2 Using YouTube Studio</h4><p>You can also enable the green screen to subscribe via the YouTube Studio. It is a YouTube application that provides you with the tools you need to create a successful YouTube channel. You can manage your videos, respond to comments and even add adverts to your content for pay. Here are the steps to add subscribe button.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>. First, go directly to “studio.youtube.com” or click on your profile picture on the YouTube page to launch YT Studio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-5.png"                      alt="add subscirbe button using youtube studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>.

Then select the “Choose” image and select which subscribe button image you wish to use as your branding watermark. You can easily get one on the Google images section.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Next, choose the display time for the branding watermark. It could be a custom start time if you want the branding watermark to start showing at a specific time. You can also choose “End or video” for it to appear at the last 10 to 15 seconds of your video. Likewise, the branding watermark can show throughout the video if you choose the “Entire video” option.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>. Finally, save the changes. Voila! Viewers can subscribe to your channel easily, with a single click of a button.</p><h4 id="3-Using-Subscribe-Effects"><a href="#3-Using-Subscribe-Effects" class="headerlink" title="3 Using Subscribe Effects"></a>3 Using Subscribe Effects</h4><p>You can also use the subscribers’ effects to add a Call To Action.

You can do this using a reliable video editor software – Filmora.</p><p>Filmora is a sophisticated tool that is easy to use and export your videos to your computer and upload them to YouTube.

With so much competition on the platform, it’s crucial that you stand out from the crowd with efficient, professional videos that are a pleasure to watch.</p><p> Without some planning and structure in mind before you begin filming, it’s all too easy to get a bit lost and start to ramble or fumble your words. Video’s filled with ‘umm’ and ‘err’ are neither pleasant to watch nor engaging.</p><p> If you’re serious about making a great YouTube channel and developing a loyal fan base, you’re going to need a workable structure for every video to help you stay on track. Here’s what you need to know:</p><p><strong>Quick Jump Menu</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Why is structuring your video important?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How should you structure YouTube Video Content?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Why-is-structuring-your-video-important"><a href="#Why-is-structuring-your-video-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is structuring your video important?"></a>Why is structuring your video important?</h2><p> The structure of your video can make all the difference between a successful YouTube channel and a big waste of time. Your objective is to get people watching more and watching all the way to the end. A great structure can:</p><ul><li><strong>Build interest and engagement</strong>: By keeping something in reserve and naturally building interest as you go along, people will be compelled to watch longer and interact more with your channel.</li><li><strong>Helps you rank higher</strong>: Longer and higher numbers of views will demonstrate your position as an authority well. The YouTube algorithm uses these metrics as part of their ranking factor, so the more and longer views you get, the higher you’ll rank in search.</li><li><strong>Builds consistency and familiarity</strong>: If all your videos follow a typical structure, your fans will come to be familiar with your format. They’ll know what to expect from your content and will watch more regularly as a result.</li></ul><p> So, now you understand why structure is so important to your channel, let’s take a look at ways in which you can create an amazing structure for every video you produce.</p><h2 id="How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content"><a href="#How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content" class="headerlink" title="How should you structure YouTube video content?"></a>How should you structure YouTube video content?</h2><p> There are some key elements of a YouTube video’s structure which can make it more natural, more engaging and more fun to watch. When you’re planning your structure, you should follow a logical timeline to take the viewer from start to finish easily, and to ensure you get the actions you want at the end.</p><h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p> People love to be told what’s about to happen, and an intro can be a crucial step in ensuring they are going to continue watching your content. By explaining clearly what they are about to see, why it’s important to them and what problems you’re aiming to solve, you’ll keep them hooked and prevent them from browsing away to the next search result.</p><p> An introduction doesn’t need to be long or particularly involved. Remember, you don’t want to give away all your information here, as what you want is to encourage them to watch until the end. Something like “I’m going to show you … which will help you to …” is fine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-structure.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Your idea and purpose need to be conveyed fast and effectively if you’re keen to get their interest. Most viewers will decide within the first three to five seconds of a video if they want to invest their time in watching, so it’s crucial you capture their interest and engage them fast to stop them drifting away.</p><h3 id="Main-content"><a href="#Main-content" class="headerlink" title="Main content"></a>Main content</h3><p> Once you’ve introduced your video, it’s time to start working through your content. This should be done by:</p><ol><li><strong>Framing the problem</strong></li></ol><p> What are the types of problems that your viewers will have encountered which your video can solve? How is the problem affecting you and your viewers? Take around two to three minutes to describe the problems that you hope your video will solve, and work on being empathetic so people can relate to you and the issue you’re discussing.</p><ol><li><strong>Offer solutions with examples</strong></li></ol><p> Move on to your solution to the problem. How did you find this solution? Is it easy to implement? Take around four to five minutes to address your solution and give examples of how it works in practice.</p><p> Now you’ve addressed the issue that your video content will solve, you’re almost ready to ask them to take the next step. Almost. There’s one more key element in your structure that you need to remember to include.</p><h3 id="Hook"><a href="#Hook" class="headerlink" title="Hook"></a>Hook</h3><p> The hook can be placed anywhere in your content, although it’s most successful when placed either in the introduction or while you are framing the problem.

If a viewer watches more than 30 seconds of the ad or clicks it, then the YouTuber will make money.</p><p>This is a general estimate of how much a YouTuber can make from ads once they qualify:</p><p>- 68% of advertisers ad spend goes to the video creator.

Your content must be discovered by the right people:</strong> If the wrong people find your content, then you aren’t going to make any sales. To get the right eyes on your videos, you’ll need to do some research on your target audience and what keywords they use when searching for your product or services.</p><p>If you are selling a meditation eBook and guided meditation services, type in some possible keywords in the YouTube search bar. What appears will be some popular searches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/meditation3.png"                      alt="meditation"                ></p><p>From there, take your possible keywords and put them into a tool such as <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to find other related keywords. This will help you create discoverable content that will catch the interest of those who will buy what you are selling.</p><p> <strong>2. Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well. Have a clear call to action somewhere on your website.

Her YouTube channel gave her an audience and proved to publishers that there was enough demand for her to write a book that people will read.</p><p> As you <a class="link"   href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/get-more-youtube-subscribers-increase-video-views/" >grow your audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will find that there will be a demand for certain products or services that don’t already exist. This is where you put on your entrepreneur hat and think of something that your audience will pay money for and make it happen. Odds are, when it happens, it wouldn’t even be a mystery, your audience will tell you to make or supply it.</p><p>For example, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uke6eXzgjQQ" >Remi Cruz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a YouTuber with over 2.2 million subscribers.

The odds of a brand reaching out to you, as a small creator, is unlikely to happen.</p><p>If you want to get a brand deal and become an influencer on YouTube, then you will have to put yourself out there to be discovered and that is on an Influencer Marketing Network, such as <a class="link"   href="https://famebit.com/" >Famebit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/famebit-brand10.jpg"                      alt="famebit brand"                ></p><h4 id="How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works"><a href="#How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works" class="headerlink" title="How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works"></a><strong>How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works</strong></h4><p>When you sign up for Famebit or other influencer marketing platforms you have an opportunity to get in front of brands who are seeking influencers to share their product or service.</p><p>Steps to getting a brand deal:</p><ol><li>Find brands and campaigns that match your audience.</li><li>Pitch your creative ideas and present the proposal to the brand within their parameters (product review, 30-60 shoutout, etc.)</li><li>If accepted, you are hired and will begin collaboration with the brand to produce the project.</li><li>Build our content.</li><li>Receive approval from the brand.</li><li>Get Paid!</li></ol><p> Unlike celebrity marketing, YouTube creators have shown brands over the years that they are inventive and clever with how they can present the brand to the audience to drive the best results.

It doesn’t take stardom to start asking for donations, pledge, or support from your fans. There is a demand for quality content and if you are creating something of value, even on a free service like YouTube, people will happily pay to support it.</p><p>But how can you approach crowdfunding so it doesn’t look like you are begging?</p><h4 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding" class="headerlink" title="3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:</strong></h4><p><strong>- Tiered Rewards: You can give incentives for your patrons in different tiers. Example: a donation of $2-$10 gives them a shoutout in your next video, a donation of $20-$100 gets them an exclusive spot in a live stream, and more extravagant offerings as the donations increase.</strong></p><p><strong>- Membership:</strong> This method of crowdfunding allows your fans to donate on a recurring basis. Treat your channel like it’s HBO and deliver higher-value content. Your members will be the first to see the increase of quality in and frequency of your work.</p><p>- <strong>Project-based:</strong>  Is there a special project you have in mind, get support for it. A longer-form video or one that your fans have been wanting for a while, by highlighting this anticipated project, you can get more backing behind it financially.</p><p> From Sept-Oct 2011, the YouTube channel Freddiew (aka RocketJump) went on <a class="link"   href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freddiew/video-game-high-school" >Kickstarter to crowdfund <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>so they can produce a web series called Video Game High School. In 30 days, they were able to surpass their goal of $75,000 with $273,725 and 5,661 backers. The result is a multiple season web series, the first one published onto YouTube in May 2012.</p><p> Without crowdfunding, the project would unlikely have been produced and published for viewers in such a short amount of time.</p><h4 id="Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations"><a href="#Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations" class="headerlink" title="Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations"></a><strong>Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations</strong></h4><p>Have you ever gone up to a friend and ask for $5?

Your content must be discovered by the right people:</strong> If the wrong people find your content, then you aren’t going to make any sales. To get the right eyes on your videos, you’ll need to do some research on your target audience and what keywords they use when searching for your product or services.</p><p>If you are selling a meditation eBook and guided meditation services, type in some possible keywords in the YouTube search bar. What appears will be some popular searches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/meditation3.png"                      alt="meditation"                ></p><p>From there, take your possible keywords and put them into a tool such as <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to find other related keywords. This will help you create discoverable content that will catch the interest of those who will buy what you are selling.</p><p> <strong>2. Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well.

This is where you put on your entrepreneur hat and think of something that your audience will pay money for and make it happen. Odds are, when it happens, it wouldn’t even be a mystery, your audience will tell you to make or supply it.</p><p>For example, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uke6eXzgjQQ" >Remi Cruz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a YouTuber with over 2.2 million subscribers.

The odds of a brand reaching out to you, as a small creator, is unlikely to happen.</p><p>If you want to get a brand deal and become an influencer on YouTube, then you will have to put yourself out there to be discovered and that is on an Influencer Marketing Network, such as <a class="link"   href="https://famebit.com/" >Famebit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/famebit-brand10.jpg"                      alt="famebit brand"                ></p><h4 id="How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works-1"><a href="#How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works-1" class="headerlink" title="How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works"></a><strong>How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works</strong></h4><p>When you sign up for Famebit or other influencer marketing platforms you have an opportunity to get in front of brands who are seeking influencers to share their product or service.</p><p>Steps to getting a brand deal:</p><ol><li>Find brands and campaigns that match your audience.</li><li>Pitch your creative ideas and present the proposal to the brand within their parameters (product review, 30-60 shoutout, etc.)</li><li>If accepted, you are hired and will begin collaboration with the brand to produce the project.</li><li>Build our content.</li><li>Receive approval from the brand.</li><li>Get Paid!</li></ol><p> Unlike celebrity marketing, YouTube creators have shown brands over the years that they are inventive and clever with how they can present the brand to the audience to drive the best results.

It doesn’t take stardom to start asking for donations, pledge, or support from your fans. There is a demand for quality content and if you are creating something of value, even on a free service like YouTube, people will happily pay to support it.</p><p>But how can you approach crowdfunding so it doesn’t look like you are begging?</p><h4 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding-1"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding-1" class="headerlink" title="3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:</strong></h4><p><strong>- Tiered Rewards: You can give incentives for your patrons in different tiers. Example: a donation of $2-$10 gives them a shoutout in your next video, a donation of $20-$100 gets them an exclusive spot in a live stream, and more extravagant offerings as the donations increase.</strong></p><p><strong>- Membership:</strong> This method of crowdfunding allows your fans to donate on a recurring basis. Treat your channel like it’s HBO and deliver higher-value content. Your members will be the first to see the increase of quality in and frequency of your work.</p><p>- <strong>Project-based:</strong>  Is there a special project you have in mind, get support for it. A longer-form video or one that your fans have been wanting for a while, by highlighting this anticipated project, you can get more backing behind it financially.</p><p> From Sept-Oct 2011, the YouTube channel Freddiew (aka RocketJump) went on <a class="link"   href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freddiew/video-game-high-school" >Kickstarter to crowdfund <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>so they can produce a web series called Video Game High School. In 30 days, they were able to surpass their goal of $75,000 with $273,725 and 5,661 backers. The result is a multiple season web series, the first one published onto YouTube in May 2012.</p><p> Without crowdfunding, the project would unlikely have been produced and published for viewers in such a short amount of time.</p><h4 id="Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations-1"><a href="#Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations-1" class="headerlink" title="Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations"></a><strong>Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations</strong></h4><p>Have you ever gone up to a friend and ask for $5?

Your content must be discovered by the right people:</strong> If the wrong people find your content, then you aren’t going to make any sales. To get the right eyes on your videos, you’ll need to do some research on your target audience and what keywords they use when searching for your product or services.</p><p>If you are selling a meditation eBook and guided meditation services, type in some possible keywords in the YouTube search bar. What appears will be some popular searches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/meditation3.png"                      alt="meditation"                ></p><p>From there, take your possible keywords and put them into a tool such as <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to find other related keywords. This will help you create discoverable content that will catch the interest of those who will buy what you are selling.</p><p> <strong>2. Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well.

This is where you put on your entrepreneur hat and think of something that your audience will pay money for and make it happen. Odds are, when it happens, it wouldn’t even be a mystery, your audience will tell you to make or supply it.</p><p>For example, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uke6eXzgjQQ" >Remi Cruz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a YouTuber with over 2.2 million subscribers.

You can leverage that by participating in affiliate marketing as a YouTuber.</p><h4 id="How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube-2"><a href="#How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?"></a><strong>How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?</strong></h4><p>As a YouTuber, you can share your thoughts on products or services, and if there are products that you recommend, by simply adding a personalized link to the product page, you can get a commission for every sale of that product that came through your link.</p><p>The average affiliate commission rate is between 5% to 30%, with a lot of variables. Some low price range items will have a higher commission, while higher-priced items will have lower commissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliat-link8.jpg"                      alt="affiliate links"                ></p><p><em>Travel YouTuber,</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SorelleIAm"><em>Sorelle Amore</em></a><em>’s affiliate links to her vlogging gears.</em></p><p> Keep in mind that people are most likely going to take recommendations from people they trust.

If the video is about vlogging microphones, then it makes complete sense to have an affiliate link to your favorite microphone. Odds are the people who are watching the video may be considering buying a new microphone, so the link is helpful for them.</p><p>Here are a few types of videos that make for good affiliate marketing opportunities:</p><p>- Product reviews</p><p>- Top 10</p><p>- How-tos</p><p>- Cheap vs expensive</p><p>- What to pack for…</p><p> <strong>How to Get an Affiliate Marketing Link for YouTube?</strong></p><p>Which affiliate marketing program you choose to sign up with will depend on the products you want to link to through your content.

Brand Deal or Sponsorships:</strong></h2><p>Selling out, that is often the thought when we hear creators getting brand deals and sponsorships, but that stigma is unfounded if the brand and the content are properly aligned. As your channel grows, you will begin to recognize brands that match your values — and the values of your viewers — and those that don’t.</p><p>Today, more and more brands are collaborating with YouTube creators, because <a class="link"   href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/video/youtube-influencer-marketing-rulebook/" >creators are 4x more effective in earning brand familiarity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than collaborations with traditional celebrities.</p><p>In an ad for Beats by Dre’s #BuiltForBosses campaign, YouTuber <a class="link"   href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-self-made-star-shows-one-way-to-crack-the-gen-z-code-1511719567?mod=e2tw" >Liza Koshy outperformed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the likes of Tom Brady and DJ Khaled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perform-the-likes9.jpg"                      alt="perform the likes"                ></p><p>While it does take significant effort on YouTube to acquire a following, it is possible for a YouTube channel with 1,000 subscribers to get a brand deal.

The odds of a brand reaching out to you, as a small creator, is unlikely to happen.</p><p>If you want to get a brand deal and become an influencer on YouTube, then you will have to put yourself out there to be discovered and that is on an Influencer Marketing Network, such as <a class="link"   href="https://famebit.com/" >Famebit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/famebit-brand10.jpg"                      alt="famebit brand"                ></p><h4 id="How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works-2"><a href="#How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works-2" class="headerlink" title="How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works"></a><strong>How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works</strong></h4><p>When you sign up for Famebit or other influencer marketing platforms you have an opportunity to get in front of brands who are seeking influencers to share their product or service.</p><p>Steps to getting a brand deal:</p><ol><li>Find brands and campaigns that match your audience.</li><li>Pitch your creative ideas and present the proposal to the brand within their parameters (product review, 30-60 shoutout, etc.)</li><li>If accepted, you are hired and will begin collaboration with the brand to produce the project.</li><li>Build our content.</li><li>Receive approval from the brand.</li><li>Get Paid!</li></ol><p> Unlike celebrity marketing, YouTube creators have shown brands over the years that they are inventive and clever with how they can present the brand to the audience to drive the best results.

Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>4. Crowdfunding:</strong></h2><p>If you are creating valuable content and have a loyal following, you can start thinking about crowdfunding. It doesn’t take stardom to start asking for donations, pledge, or support from your fans. There is a demand for quality content and if you are creating something of value, even on a free service like YouTube, people will happily pay to support it.</p><p>But how can you approach crowdfunding so it doesn’t look like you are begging?</p><h4 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding-2"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding-2" class="headerlink" title="3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:</strong></h4><p><strong>- Tiered Rewards: You can give incentives for your patrons in different tiers. Example: a donation of $2-$10 gives them a shoutout in your next video, a donation of $20-$100 gets them an exclusive spot in a live stream, and more extravagant offerings as the donations increase.</strong></p><p><strong>- Membership:</strong> This method of crowdfunding allows your fans to donate on a recurring basis. Treat your channel like it’s HBO and deliver higher-value content. Your members will be the first to see the increase of quality in and frequency of your work.</p><p>- <strong>Project-based:</strong>  Is there a special project you have in mind, get support for it. A longer-form video or one that your fans have been wanting for a while, by highlighting this anticipated project, you can get more backing behind it financially.</p><p> From Sept-Oct 2011, the YouTube channel Freddiew (aka RocketJump) went on <a class="link"   href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freddiew/video-game-high-school" >Kickstarter to crowdfund <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>so they can produce a web series called Video Game High School. In 30 days, they were able to surpass their goal of $75,000 with $273,725 and 5,661 backers. The result is a multiple season web series, the first one published onto YouTube in May 2012.</p><p> Without crowdfunding, the project would unlikely have been produced and published for viewers in such a short amount of time.</p><h4 id="Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations-2"><a href="#Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations-2" class="headerlink" title="Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations"></a><strong>Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations</strong></h4><p>Have you ever gone up to a friend and ask for $5?

Your content must be discovered by the right people:</strong> If the wrong people find your content, then you aren’t going to make any sales. To get the right eyes on your videos, you’ll need to do some research on your target audience and what keywords they use when searching for your product or services.</p><p>If you are selling a meditation eBook and guided meditation services, type in some possible keywords in the YouTube search bar. What appears will be some popular searches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/meditation3.png"                      alt="meditation"                ></p><p>From there, take your possible keywords and put them into a tool such as <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to find other related keywords. This will help you create discoverable content that will catch the interest of those who will buy what you are selling.</p><p> <strong>2. Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well.

This is where you put on your entrepreneur hat and think of something that your audience will pay money for and make it happen. Odds are, when it happens, it wouldn’t even be a mystery, your audience will tell you to make or supply it.</p><p>For example, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uke6eXzgjQQ" >Remi Cruz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a YouTuber with over 2.2 million subscribers.

You can leverage that by participating in affiliate marketing as a YouTuber.</p><h4 id="How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube-3"><a href="#How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?"></a><strong>How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?</strong></h4><p>As a YouTuber, you can share your thoughts on products or services, and if there are products that you recommend, by simply adding a personalized link to the product page, you can get a commission for every sale of that product that came through your link.</p><p>The average affiliate commission rate is between 5% to 30%, with a lot of variables. Some low price range items will have a higher commission, while higher-priced items will have lower commissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliat-link8.jpg"                      alt="affiliate links"                ></p><p><em>Travel YouTuber,</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SorelleIAm"><em>Sorelle Amore</em></a><em>’s affiliate links to her vlogging gears.</em></p><p> Keep in mind that people are most likely going to take recommendations from people they trust. You wouldn’t buy a computer from a nutritionist and you wouldn’t buy vitamins from a gamer, so consider what you are an expert in and what products you have the most authority to speak about.</p><h4 id="What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing-3"><a href="#What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?"></a><strong>What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?</strong></h4><p>There are no restrictions on what will make a good affiliate marketing video, but there are best practices.</p><p>What’s important is understanding the purpose of the video. If the video is about vlogging microphones, then it makes complete sense to have an affiliate link to your favorite microphone. Odds are the people who are watching the video may be considering buying a new microphone, so the link is helpful for them.</p><p>Here are a few types of videos that make for good affiliate marketing opportunities:</p><p>- Product reviews</p><p>- Top 10</p><p>- How-tos</p><p>- Cheap vs expensive</p><p>- What to pack for…</p><p> <strong>How to Get an Affiliate Marketing Link for YouTube?</strong></p><p>Which affiliate marketing program you choose to sign up with will depend on the products you want to link to through your content. Do some research on what each network has to offer in regards to your niche.</p><p>Here is the list of 4 popular affiliate marketing networks:</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" >Amazon Associates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://rakutenmarketing.com/affiliate" >Rakuten <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.shareasale.com/" >ShareASale <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://peerfly.com/" >PeerFly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can also partner with brands directly as many of them, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.sephora.com/affiliates" >Sephora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/affiliate-program" >Canon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, will have their own affiliate program.</p><h2 id="3-Brand-Deal-or-Sponsorships-3"><a href="#3-Brand-Deal-or-Sponsorships-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Brand Deal or Sponsorships:"></a><strong>3. Brand Deal or Sponsorships:</strong></h2><p>Selling out, that is often the thought when we hear creators getting brand deals and sponsorships, but that stigma is unfounded if the brand and the content are properly aligned. As your channel grows, you will begin to recognize brands that match your values — and the values of your viewers — and those that don’t.</p><p>Today, more and more brands are collaborating with YouTube creators, because <a class="link"   href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/video/youtube-influencer-marketing-rulebook/" >creators are 4x more effective in earning brand familiarity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than collaborations with traditional celebrities.</p><p>In an ad for Beats by Dre’s #BuiltForBosses campaign, YouTuber <a class="link"   href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-self-made-star-shows-one-way-to-crack-the-gen-z-code-1511719567?mod=e2tw" >Liza Koshy outperformed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the likes of Tom Brady and DJ Khaled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perform-the-likes9.jpg"                      alt="perform the likes"                ></p><p>While it does take significant effort on YouTube to acquire a following, it is possible for a YouTube channel with 1,000 subscribers to get a brand deal. Getting the buy-in from brands is a numbers game, and according to <a class="link"   href="https://videocreators.com/how-to-get-started-with-brand-deals-on-youtube/" >Video Creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the minimal number of views per video shouldn’t be lower than 2,000 if this is the path you want to head in.</p><h4 id="How-to-Get-Discovered-By-Brands-3"><a href="#How-to-Get-Discovered-By-Brands-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Discovered By Brands"></a><strong>How to Get Discovered By Brands</strong></h4><p>The decision-makers behind brands might not be aware of influencers with a smaller following — those who have just cracked the 5,000 subscriber mark. The odds of a brand reaching out to you, as a small creator, is unlikely to happen.</p><p>If you want to get a brand deal and become an influencer on YouTube, then you will have to put yourself out there to be discovered and that is on an Influencer Marketing Network, such as <a class="link"   href="https://famebit.com/" >Famebit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/famebit-brand10.jpg"                      alt="famebit brand"                ></p><h4 id="How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works-3"><a href="#How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works-3" class="headerlink" title="How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works"></a><strong>How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works</strong></h4><p>When you sign up for Famebit or other influencer marketing platforms you have an opportunity to get in front of brands who are seeking influencers to share their product or service.</p><p>Steps to getting a brand deal:</p><ol><li>Find brands and campaigns that match your audience.</li><li>Pitch your creative ideas and present the proposal to the brand within their parameters (product review, 30-60 shoutout, etc.)</li><li>If accepted, you are hired and will begin collaboration with the brand to produce the project.</li><li>Build our content.</li><li>Receive approval from the brand.</li><li>Get Paid!</li></ol><p> Unlike celebrity marketing, YouTube creators have shown brands over the years that they are inventive and clever with how they can present the brand to the audience to drive the best results. This type of independence is what makes YouTube influencer marketing special.</p><h2 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><h2 id="4-Crowdfunding-3"><a href="#4-Crowdfunding-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>4. Crowdfunding:</strong></h2><p>If you are creating valuable content and have a loyal following, you can start thinking about crowdfunding. It doesn’t take stardom to start asking for donations, pledge, or support from your fans. There is a demand for quality content and if you are creating something of value, even on a free service like YouTube, people will happily pay to support it.</p><p>But how can you approach crowdfunding so it doesn’t look like you are begging?</p><h4 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding-3"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding-3" class="headerlink" title="3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:</strong></h4><p><strong>- Tiered Rewards: You can give incentives for your patrons in different tiers. Example: a donation of $2-$10 gives them a shoutout in your next video, a donation of $20-$100 gets them an exclusive spot in a live stream, and more extravagant offerings as the donations increase.</strong></p><p><strong>- Membership:</strong> This method of crowdfunding allows your fans to donate on a recurring basis. Treat your channel like it’s HBO and deliver higher-value content. Your members will be the first to see the increase of quality in and frequency of your work.</p><p>- <strong>Project-based:</strong>  Is there a special project you have in mind, get support for it. A longer-form video or one that your fans have been wanting for a while, by highlighting this anticipated project, you can get more backing behind it financially.</p><p> From Sept-Oct 2011, the YouTube channel Freddiew (aka RocketJump) went on <a class="link"   href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freddiew/video-game-high-school" >Kickstarter to crowdfund <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>so they can produce a web series called Video Game High School. In 30 days, they were able to surpass their goal of $75,000 with $273,725 and 5,661 backers. The result is a multiple season web series, the first one published onto YouTube in May 2012.</p><p> Without crowdfunding, the project would unlikely have been produced and published for viewers in such a short amount of time.</p><h4 id="Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations-3"><a href="#Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations-3" class="headerlink" title="Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations"></a><strong>Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations</strong></h4><p>Have you ever gone up to a friend and ask for $5? What did they say?</p><p>“What do you need it for?”</p><p>We are more willing to give money if we know where it is going. Let your audience know exactly what you are planning to spend the funds on and how it will benefit them. One way to really encourage them is to have a goal, for example, a trip to a conference, and a special video will be produced to highlight the event.</p><h4 id="Set-a-Target-3"><a href="#Set-a-Target-3" class="headerlink" title="Set a $ Target"></a><strong>Set a $ Target</strong></h4><p>If you have a pie in the sky goal, you aren’t going to fully leverage the message to your audience. Understand how much money you need to produce a video or to pursue a more ambitious project. What do you need in order to grow and make the best channel you can.</p><h4 id="How-Does-Patreon-Work-for-YouTubers-3"><a href="#How-Does-Patreon-Work-for-YouTubers-3" class="headerlink" title="How Does Patreon Work for YouTubers?"></a><strong>How Does Patreon Work for YouTubers?</strong></h4><p>When it comes to crowdfunding for YouTubers, <a class="link"   href="https://www.patreon.com/" >Patreon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is the platform of choice. While other platforms such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe are focused on entrepreneurial pursuits, large projects, or charitable causes, Patreon is designed to support creatives and reward and incentivize donors.</p><h2 id="Key-Takeaways-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways:"></a><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h2><p>There are many ways to make money off of YouTube, I encourage you to try a few of these different strategies and see how they perform and which one suits your channel and your audience the best.</p><ol><li>Directing your viewers to your website where they can pay for a product or service that you offer.</li><li>Sign up with an affiliate program such as Amazon Associates and create content about interesting products.</li><li>Find brands that match your channel’s values and propose ideas via influencer marketing platforms such as Famebit.</li><li>Set up a Patreon page and encourage viewers to donate to get incentives or to support a bigger better project.</li></ol><p>Got questions about making money on YouTube?

The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother’s phone to post gaming tutorial videos.

YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you’ll earn at least $1,500. <strong>Techno Gamerz YouTube income</strong> per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.</p><p>Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That’s not all; you’ll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube’s payroll.</p><p>With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the <strong>Techno Gamerz monthly income</strong>, number of views, and more:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Estimated Monthly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</th><th>$167K</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Estimated Yearly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</td><td>$8.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total video uploads</td><td>858</td></tr><tr><td>Type of videos</td><td>Gaming tutorials</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>29 million</td></tr><tr><td>Video views</td><td>7.5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 days’ views</td><td>7 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram.
