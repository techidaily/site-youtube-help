What’s the ideal YouTube thumbnail Size and Dimension?</strong></h2><p>An essential thing that every YouTube video developer needs to know is about the selection of the right side of the thumbnail for any video. As per the guidelines circulated by Google itself, the most appropriate size for the thumbnail image is 1280x720 pixels, where the recommended minimal pixel width is 640 pixels. Generally, the 16:9 ratio is considered as an ideal choice for Most of YouTube previews and players.</p><p>Here is one interesting thing that you need to know; the thumbnail of videos appears smaller during searches, but it naturally grows to the full size of a video during suggestions. Now the fact is that upscaling of images often loses the quality of content, whereas it is much easier to downscale larger images into smaller ones. Hence, the best idea is to use large size images so that this search and suggestion based scaling needs can be well accomplished.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 12 Best Free YouTube Thumbnail Makers &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download YouTube Thumbnail in 3 Ways [Online&#x2F;Win&#x2F;Mac] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-Tips-for-Perfect-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Tips-for-Perfect-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2.

Although the idea is good and original, these thumbnails use to be of low quality with blur details. Hope! You don’t want to lose your audience with this bad selection.</p><h4 id="Custom-Thumbnails"><a href="#Custom-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Custom Thumbnails"></a><strong>Custom Thumbnails</strong></h4><p>This is probably the best choice for your customized videos, and the interesting thing is that here you can control everything manually with lots of useful effects.</p><p>First of all, you need to open your video on YouTube and then scrub a useful still from your video that you wish to use as a thumbnail.</p><p>Now, you need to take a screenshot of this particular instance of your video file. The best part is that most of the operating systems allow users to enjoy several shortcuts to complete this task. For example:</p><p>Mac users need to press Command+Shift+4 and then simply highlight the area that you want to include in your screenshot with the help of a frame. The system will automatically save your selected area to your desktop in the form of an image.</p><p>Window users are advised to access Windows Key with Print Screen option to get their desired screenshot.</p><p>Once you are ready with your video specific still image, then simply get it uploaded on YouTube using the edit video page.</p><h2 id="3-Making-Better-Thumbnails-for-YouTube"><a href="#3-Making-Better-Thumbnails-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="3.

It will naturally attract more viewers.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Borders matter:</em></strong></li></ul><p>Professionals recommend adding borders around thumbnail images but do not try to make it too thick rather, try to make it noticeable with fine details.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Background editing:</em></strong></li></ul><p>Most of the expert video thumbnail developers prefer to change the impact of thumbnail background by simply replacing the background color with solid colors. It will definitely attract more viewers and will bring major attention to the major subject.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Test it before uploading:</em></strong></li></ul><p>Before uploading your customized thumbnail to your YouTube channel, prefer to check its final view.

Other file formats like 3GPP and MPEG-PS generally have resolutions too small for high-resolution tablets or desktop devices.</p><p>If your phone or video editing software does not output MP4 videos, consider getting video editing software or a conversion program that can (like Filmora Video Editor).</p><p>Filmora is an easy-to-use video editing program that can export to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, F4V, MKV, TS, 3GP, MPEG-2, WEBM, GIF, and MP3. You can convert a video to an MP4 simply by importing it into Filmora, dragging it into the timeline, and exporting it in the MP4 format.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Upload-Settings-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#The-Best-Upload-Settings-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="The Best Upload Settings for YouTube"></a>The Best Upload Settings for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The best video code:</strong></p><p><strong>The best video format:</strong> MP4</p><p>Audio should be produced using the LC format and stereo 5.1 or standard stereo. You can upload separate MP3 audio format files for voiceovers if you need to.</p><p>The aspect ratio for a video should be 16:9 so that it won’t have black bars on the side when uploaded to YouTube. YouTube has also made it possible for 9:16 (portrait) style videos to be viewed without black bars, full screen, using their iOS app.</p><p>You should export in at least 30 frames per second. Many creators push that to 60 frames per second, which is better for most types of videos (although it may not make a noticeable difference for others).</p><p>The maximum size for quick upload and load time on YouTube is generally under 2gb. Luckily MP4 offers a great degree of compression without sacrificing too much image quality.</p><p>If you scale down the file size of the video by reducing the resolution or choosing a format with more compression, that can cause you to lose quality. If you need a smaller file, it’s always better to scale down the length of a video rather than continually compress the file or lose frames from the video.</p><p>Although a 2 GB file of a very long will easily upload to YouTube, it will probably be very low quality.</p><p> Do you agree that MP4 is the best video format for YouTube, or do you use something else?</p><h2 id="Create-Stunning-Videos-with-a-High-Quality-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Create-Stunning-Videos-with-a-High-Quality-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Create Stunning Videos with a High-Quality Video Editor"></a>Create Stunning Videos with a High-Quality Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-deciphering-the-sideways-photo-puzzle-on-ig/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Deciphering the Sideways Photo Puzzle on IG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-streamlining-video-editing-in-obs-with-luts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Streamlining Video Editing in OBS With LUTs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-imovie-videos-on-your-youtube-channel/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step IMovie Videos on Your YouTube Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-slay-the-game-designing-quirky-text-memes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Slay the Game Designing Quirky Text Memes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-rapid-share-tactics-for-youtube-lists/"><u>2024 Approved Rapid Share Tactics for YouTube Lists</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-social-sphere-shift-identifying-the-days-hottest-tweets/"><u>2024 Approved Social Sphere Shift Identifying the Day's Hottest Tweets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-youtube-potential-with-perpetual-creative-commons-membership/"><u>2024 Approved Unlocking YouTube Potential with Perpetual Creative Commons Membership</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/correcting-d3dx933dll-file-absence-best-practices-and-solutions/"><u>Correcting d3dx9_33.dll File Absence: Best Practices and Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/decoding-economic-advice-through-emojis-delving-into-recent-events-at-activision-and-chatgpts-impact-on-employment-opportunities/"><u>Decoding Economic Advice Through Emojis: Delving Into Recent Events at Activision & ChatGPT's Impact on Employment Opportunities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/tional-7-cameras-elevating-online-educational-vlogs-for-2024/"><u>Exceptional 7 Cameras Elevating Online Educational Vlogs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/how-to-use-video-titles-and-youtube-tags-for-2024/"><u>How to Use Video Titles and YouTube Tags for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-laugh-and-learn-with-animated-youtubers-top-picks-for-today/"><u>In 2024, Laugh and Learn with Animated YouTubers - Top Picks for Today</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

With this <strong>YouTube’s speed control</strong>, 1 is the normal speed, with 0.25 being one-quarter (1&#x2F;4th) of the actual speed and slowing the video. In the same vein, 2x is twice the average speed, increasing the video speed.</p><p>However, in as much as <strong>YouTube speed control</strong> slows or speeds up the video, it does not change the pitch of the video. All it does is either expand or compress the video samples while still maintaining the video or audio pitch.

So, regardless of what tempo, genre, or style your DJ set is, this template will sync with it perfectly and make everything look more professional, modern, funky, or whatever result you prefer.</p><p>There are three main characteristics of DJ template videos, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-Designed Visuals:</strong> These templates are ready-made visuals that can be used as-is or customized further. They range from abstract patterns and pulsating geometries to thematic scenes and rhythmic animations.</li><li><strong>Customizable Elements:</strong> You can personally customize many of these templates. This might include integrating logos and text or tweaking the color scheme to match the event’s theme.</li><li><strong>Format and Compatibility:</strong> They are usually available in formats compatible with common VJing and DJing software, ensuring seamless integration into the DJ’s setup.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters"><a href="#Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?"></a>Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?</h2><p>Every DJ out there has their own unique style. This can be displayed by the music they play, the events they attend, the style of clothing they wear, and so on. Well, the same style can be represented by their videos as well.</p><p>With that said, it’s crucial that you make your video in such a way that your style is kept and immediately recognized by your fans. That can easily be achieved with a background template video for your set.</p><p>After all, your goal is to create an unforgettable experience that truly impresses everyone.

They range from abstract patterns and pulsating geometries to thematic scenes and rhythmic animations.</li><li><strong>Customizable Elements:</strong> You can personally customize many of these templates. This might include integrating logos and text or tweaking the color scheme to match the event’s theme.</li><li><strong>Format and Compatibility:</strong> They are usually available in formats compatible with common VJing and DJing software, ensuring seamless integration into the DJ’s setup.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters-1"><a href="#Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?"></a>Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?</h2><p>Every DJ out there has their own unique style.

It needs something or someone to hold it. Do you just accept that and shoot everything as a selfie?</p><p>No. No, you don’t, because there are common household items that can help you out of this problem. For this DIY tripod, you need either <strong>2 binder clips</strong> or <strong>2 ‘claw clips’</strong> (also called ‘hair jaws’).</p><p>Hold your phone in landscape mode (horizontally, so it’s long rather than tall) and attach clips to the bottom corners.

That doesn’t mean you have to take out a loan and spend thousands to purchase a brand new camera and all other gadgets that professional filmmakers use.</p><p>The smartest way to get started is to go through a list of <strong>necessary equipment for YouTube</strong> and check whether or not you already own some of it. Once your channel starts growing, you can then start thinking about whether you want to invest in upgraded equipment. Here is a quick overview of all items that you need to start entertaining your online audience and gaining subscribers to your YouTube channel:</p><ul><li><a href="#camera">Your YouTube Camera</a></li><li><a href="#mic">Microphones and Audio</a></li><li><a href="#light">Lighting Gear for YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#tripod">Tripods and Camera Stands</a></li><li><a href="#phone">Smartphone Camera Gear</a></li></ul><h2 id="YouTube-Cameras"><a href="#YouTube-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Cameras"></a>YouTube Cameras</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Use whatever you already have, even if it’s your phone or webcam. It’s nice to have sharp, fine-tuned, 4K footage, but viewers will forgive lower visual quality if your content is good.</p><p><strong>The long version: You</strong> will need a camera, but there are a lot of different devices you can use including DSLRs, point and shoots, webcams, and your smartphone.</p><p>Your choice of camera will have a tremendous impact on the visual quality of your content and might drive your decisions regarding other pieces of equipment. However, you shouldn’t feel obliged to work with a top-notch camera from day one, especially since cheaper options can produce great results if used the right way.</p><p>On one end of the spectrum, you have basic smartphone cameras and web cameras, which are easy to come by and simple to operate. These days, high-end phones come equipped with quite powerful cameras that are more than sufficient for the needs of the average YouTuber. Better webcams can also do the job, although high-performance webcam models can get pretty expensive too. It is probably wise to resist the urge to start broadcasting with the built-in camera in your laptop and at least get a webcam or use your phone, but your computer’s camera is still always an option. Not having a better camera should never stop you from making YouTube videos.</p><p>If you already have a DSLR camera then it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with it. You have far more freedom to adjust the settings and achieve a professional look for your videos with a DSLR, but that does mean it’ll take some time to become an expert at using it. Ultra-high resolution is not required for YouTube, but it certainly won’t hurt to have additional sharpness and more detail in the scene. If you’re shopping for a DSLR, look for one with a flip screen that allows you to quickly check what your viewers see.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio"><a href="#YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphone and Audio"></a>YouTube Microphone and Audio</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Audio quality is extremely important. If you can buy either a new camera or an external microphone, but not both, it might be better to go for the microphone. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here for advice on upping your audio quality without an external microphone. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Sound capturing is every bit as important for your success as your video feed. In fact, poor audio can be even more damaging to your subscriber count than grainy video, since people won’t spend their time listening to something they have to put effort into understanding.</p><p>Again, most YouTube video makers have a limited budget at their disposal, so professional microphones are mostly off the table. However, investing in a directional microphone (‘shotgun mic’) that can pick up your voice clearly and without background noise is certainly a smart move. Such microphones can be pointed towards you while you speak, and since most YouTubers sit still while doing their shows there won’t be too much need for in-session adjustments.</p><p>If you’re not ready to invest in a shotgun mic, you can also find very inexpensive (often under $20) LAV mics. These small microphones can be pinned to your shirt, which allows them to record very clear dialogue because they’re so close to your mouth.</p><h2 id="Lights-for-YouTube"><a href="#Lights-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Lights for YouTube"></a>Lights for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need as much light as you can get. Lighting kits can be affordable on Amazon, but you can also achieve a great look using daylight&#x2F;windows and ‘daylight’ lightbulbs.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> If you’ve ever tried to make a video indoors, you already know that it’s necessary to have additional light. Often just filming with the normal lights in a room will cause your footage to look dark and grainy, and possibly be tinted orange. To overcome these problems you need to increase the amount of light you have available.</p><p>Sometimes, it is enough to film near windows and&#x2F;or bring more household lamps into your filming area. For any household lamps or lighting fixtures you use, make sure to put in white or ‘daylight’ lightbulbs instead of using the orange&#x2F;tungsten bulbs that you might have for everyday use (this is how you avoid tinting things orange).</p><p>If you have the budget available to get some lighting equipment, you can find softbox lights or LED panel lights available fairly inexpensively online. Softbox lights are great because they provide even, diffused, light.</p><p>Another useful piece of lighting equipment to have is a reflector. A reflector is usually a piece of white, silver, or gold fabric stretched over a frame. You can use it to bounce light from one light source back towards yourself (this is a great way to fill shadows cast by your main light). Reflectors tend to be inexpensive, but you can also use white cardboard or tinfoil in place of purchasing a reflector.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tripods-and-Camera-Stands"><a href="#Tripods-and-Camera-Stands" class="headerlink" title="Tripods and Camera Stands"></a>Tripods and Camera Stands</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need something to hold your camera. If you mostly film in your own home that can be a desk or a stack of books, but if you make a lot of videos while you’re on the go you probably need a tripod or gimbal. Heavier cameras need heavier tripods.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> While handheld cameras can deliver solid results for vloggers and casual streamers, viewers do expect reasonably stable footage. For many types of videos, the camera needs to be completely still and flatly positioned on a horizontal plane. Tripods and camera stands can cost very little, so it’s a good idea to look into getting some kind of stabilizer.</p><p>When you are choosing a tripod, pay attention to how much it weighs. If the camera that needs to be mounted on it is very heavy (like some DSLR models), you want to ensure that the structure itself weighs enough not to be easily tipped over. Too thin tripods can put your camera at risk, and that’s the last thing you want. Smaller cameras such as GoPros are more flexible in this regard and can be placed on a wider range of tripods.</p><p>Even if you are using a phone or a webcam to record YouTube videos, you should consider mounting the device on a stable stand. It is possible to find mini tripods ideal for smartphones for as little as $10. These tripods are small enough to carry in your pocket, so you will be prepared to start making a video no matter where your adventures take you. If you are using a web camera, you should attach it to the stand so that it won’t move accidentally after you touch the surface it is placed on.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135363/19272" target="_top" id="2135363">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135363" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135363/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Smartphone-Camera-Gear"><a href="#Smartphone-Camera-Gear" class="headerlink" title="Smartphone Camera Gear"></a>Smartphone Camera Gear</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-gear.jpg"                      alt="Smartphone Camera Gear"                ></p><p><strong>The short version:</strong> There’s a lot of gear out there designed with smartphone photos and videos in mind, including clip-on lenses, tripod mounts, phone-mounted LED lights, and inexpensive microphones that plug into the audio jack.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Recording your videos with a mobile phone can be a good decision. It all depends on the phone you have and the range of add-ons and apps that you complement it with. Almost every high-end model released in the past five years can shoot videos in 1080p or higher. Some can even produce 4K footage. If you perfect your smartphone filming technique, your YouTube videos could look as if they were made with pro equipment.</p><p>On the flip side, smartphone cameras typically perform poorly in low light. It is possible to download an app that lets you play around with settings to overcome this, but a phone-mounted LED light is probably a better solution. An external microphone might also be a necessity, but there are some good (inexpensive) options that can simply be plugged in through the headphone jack.</p><p>Another common downside of smartphone cameras is that most of them use digital zoom, which is vastly inferior to optical zoom. If you intend to shoot anything that’s further away than a few feet, you need a clip-on lens that goes on top of the built-in camera. This inexpensive device will give you a lot of freedom to work in space, and allow you to make spectacular shots even without high-end YouTube equipment.</p><h2

Using it isn’t that hard, but it’s definitely not a walk in the park, so we’ve taken the liberty to provide you with a comprehensive yet concise guide on how to edit YouTube videos with Final Cut Pro.</p><hr><p>Even though FCP is good software, there’s no denying that it’s pretty pricy and a little bit complicated for most beginners. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is definitely better alternatives for Final Cut Pro.

Without any further ado, let’s take a look.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP"><a href="#Step-1-Importing-the-video-clip-into-FCP" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP"></a>Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP</h4><p>This is, of course, the first thing that you need to do. Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you’ve left it over from some past event that’s long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it’s a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it’s not highlighted or you aren’t able to select it, the software doesn’t support it, and it’s not compatible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Import YouTube videos in FCP "                ></p><p>Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files. If you want to store videos from different channels, you can use the Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate in order to get them converted and stored on your computer in a format that is supported by FCP.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro"></a>Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro</h4><p>That’s the fun part. There are a few things that you can do with Final Cut Pro, and they are all quite professional.</p><ul><li>First, you can sync an audio track with your video as the DSLR cameras usually have terrible quality of the sound. This is why you want to get the audio recorded separately. The only thing you need to do is select the audio clip and click on the Synchronize Clips, and you are good to go.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sychronize-audio-clips-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Synchronize clips in FCP "                ></p><ul><li>Furthermore, you can do proper color balancing with the program quickly and incredibly easy. Go on Modify and then click on <strong>Balance Color</strong> and the software is going to take care of the rest on its own.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flip-clips-in-fcp-2.png"                      alt="adjust youtube video scale and position"                ></p><ul><li>You can also create previews when the video ends. In order to do so, you need to import your main clip, select a solid background color and place the preview video above it. You will then be able to trim and edit it conveniently. Adjust the scale and the position and you are good to go. Afterwards, you can also apply annotation on top of the preview.</li></ul><h4 id="Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly"><a href="#Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly"></a>Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-to-youtube-from-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Upload video to YouTube from FCP"                ></p><p>This one is rather easy. Here is the sequence that you need to do. Go to File -&gt; Share -&gt; Master File -&gt; Setting -&gt; File -&gt; Share -&gt; YouTube. That’s basically it. Then you need to sign in to your YouTube account and simply click on Next -&gt; Publish and the entire thing is done. That’s all you need to do in order to quickly and conveniently upload your video to YouTube directly from the FCP.</p><p>Check this video tutorial to see how YouTube creators edit their YouTubes videos with Final Cut Pro</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-troubleshoot-facebook-live-pause-strategies-for-smooth-broadcasts/"><u>[New] In 2024, Troubleshoot Facebook Live Pause Strategies for Smooth Broadcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-precision-and-proficiency-youtube-edits-in-adobe-premiere/"><u>[New] Precision & Proficiency YouTube Edits in Adobe Premiere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-absolute-zero-to-audience-peaks-top-10-insights-on-boosting-video-viewership/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Absolute Zero to Audience Peaks Top 10 Insights on Boosting Video Viewership</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premier-collectors-list-top-shorts-for-free-online/"><u>2024 Approved Premier Collector's List Top Shorts for FREE Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-reviewing-sj7s-4k-action-cam-capturing-life-to-perfection/"><u>2024 Approved Reviewing SJ7’s 4K Action Cam - Capturing Life to Perfection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-essential-guide-to-youtube-video-lighting-tips/"><u>In 2024, The Essential Guide to YouTube Video Lighting Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/step-by-step-solution-for-activating-roku-subtitlescaptions/"><u>Step-by-Step Solution for Activating Roku Subtitles/Captions</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115927/19272" target="_top" id="2115927">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115927" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115927/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Firstly because it means you have to do all the work of shooting and editing every day and secondly because it means you need to have something to talk about every single day. Even vlogging once or twice a week is tough.</p><p>How do you know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what you should talk about in your vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? Some people are so comfortable in front of the camera they can just turn it on and start talking about whatever’s on their mind, but they’re in the minority.</p><p>Before starting your daily vlogging, you have to figure out one important thing ahead of time.</p><h2 id="Do-you-have-a-niche"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-niche" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a niche?"></a>Do you have a niche?</h2><p>  You should have a niche. In a genre as broad as vlogging it is important to have some kind of hook that sets you apart from other vloggers. This can be an interest that you have, an industry you work in, or even a field of study you’re involved in at school. If you’re into technology, for example, you’ll always have a wealth of subjects to vlog about because all you’ll have to do is look at the day’s tech news and make a video reporting and commenting on it.</p><p>The other reason it’s good to have a niche is that you’ll be able to use keywords related to that niche in your video titles and tags. It’s hard to make it with a vlogging channel because nobody is searching for your content unless you are covering a specific topic like the technology they want to hear about.</p><ul><li><a href="#watching">What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</a></li><li><a href="#snapshots">Snapshots of Your Day</a></li><li><a href="#get-out">Whatever You Need to Get Out</a></li><li><a href="#learn">What did you learn today?</a></li></ul><p>Here are 4 things to talk about in your daily vlog:</p><h2 id="What-are-you-watching-reading"><a href="#What-are-you-watching-reading" class="headerlink" title="What are you watching&#x2F;reading?"></a>What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</h2><p> If you’re really into a book or tv show, or if you saw a movie recently, then those are all good things to talk about (warn people if you’re going to spoil anything!). You do recaps, reviews, or just share a few thoughts you had. If you’re worried about alienating people who don’t watch&#x2F;read the same stuff as you then you can keep it more general and just react to a few things from the media you’re consuming while also talking about your day.

In a genre as broad as vlogging it is important to have some kind of hook that sets you apart from other vloggers. This can be an interest that you have, an industry you work in, or even a field of study you’re involved in at school. If you’re into technology, for example, you’ll always have a wealth of subjects to vlog about because all you’ll have to do is look at the day’s tech news and make a video reporting and commenting on it.</p><p>The other reason it’s good to have a niche is that you’ll be able to use keywords related to that niche in your video titles and tags.

Firstly because it means you have to do all the work of shooting and editing every day and secondly because it means you need to have something to talk about every single day. Even vlogging once or twice a week is tough.</p><p>How do you know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what you should talk about in your vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? Some people are so comfortable in front of the camera they can just turn it on and start talking about whatever’s on their mind, but they’re in the minority.</p><p>Before starting your daily vlogging, you have to figure out one important thing ahead of time.</p><h2 id="Do-you-have-a-niche-3"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-niche-3" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a niche?"></a>Do you have a niche?</h2><p>  You should have a niche. In a genre as broad as vlogging it is important to have some kind of hook that sets you apart from other vloggers. This can be an interest that you have, an industry you work in, or even a field of study you’re involved in at school. If you’re into technology, for example, you’ll always have a wealth of subjects to vlog about because all you’ll have to do is look at the day’s tech news and make a video reporting and commenting on it.</p><p>The other reason it’s good to have a niche is that you’ll be able to use keywords related to that niche in your video titles and tags. It’s hard to make it with a vlogging channel because nobody is searching for your content unless you are covering a specific topic like the technology they want to hear about.</p><ul><li><a href="#watching">What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</a></li><li><a href="#snapshots">Snapshots of Your Day</a></li><li><a href="#get-out">Whatever You Need to Get Out</a></li><li><a href="#learn">What did you learn today?</a></li></ul><p>Here are 4 things to talk about in your daily vlog:</p><h2 id="What-are-you-watching-reading-3"><a href="#What-are-you-watching-reading-3" class="headerlink" title="What are you watching&#x2F;reading?"></a>What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</h2><p> If you’re really into a book or tv show, or if you saw a movie recently, then those are all good things to talk about (warn people if you’re going to spoil anything!). You do recaps, reviews, or just share a few thoughts you had. If you’re worried about alienating people who don’t watch&#x2F;read the same stuff as you then you can keep it more general and just react to a few things from the media you’re consuming while also talking about your day. It’ll give you an anchor to build the rest of your video around, even if it’s not all you talk about.</p><p>By commenting on what you’re watching&#x2F;reading you have a better chance of capitalizing on a trending topic people are searching for. You could also find yourself an audience by becoming involved in fan communities.</p><h2 id="Snapshots-of-Your-Day-3"><a href="#Snapshots-of-Your-Day-3" class="headerlink" title="Snapshots of Your Day"></a>Snapshots of Your Day</h2><p> Casey Neistat is the master of this. He is always ready with a camera on hand so that, when something interesting happens, he can capture it and build his daily vlog around it.</p><p>Carrying a camera around like Casey may or may not suit your lifestyle, but you can still pick out one story from your day to tell. It doesn’t have to be a major event, and you shouldn’t worry that it won’t be interesting to other people. It’s your personality they’re tuning in for, so even if you’re just talking about a funny thing your cat did it will keep your audience interested because a) it’s you talking about it and b) it gives them a bit of insight into your life.</p><h2 id="Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out-3"><a href="#Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out-3" class="headerlink" title="Whatever You Need to Get Out"></a>Whatever You Need to Get Out</h2><p><em>Flula is frequently puzzled by English expressions, like ‘Party Pooper’, and needs to get his confusion off his chest at odd hours of the day.</em></p><p> Ranting about people you know can get messy when people from your offline life see it, so maybe avoid that. However, if you’re angry about something in general – or really happy about something – then whatever it is you’re feeling strongly about is probably the thing you should be vlogging about.</p><p>It does not matter what it is that is making you have this strong reaction (unless, again, it’s an actual person who might see your video and cause problems for you). If you’re mad about a real injustice in the world then that’s a great thing to talk about – you might even raise some awareness for the issue – but you can also rant about your favorite flavor of yogurt being cut and that’ll be engaging to viewers too.</p><p>Alternatively: you could do a vlog about how happy you are to have gotten engaged or a vlog about how happy you are that it was sunny today, and your enthusiasm will carry your audience through either video with you.</p><h2 id="What-did-you-learn-today-3"><a href="#What-did-you-learn-today-3" class="headerlink" title="What did you learn today?"></a>What did you learn today?</h2><p> <em>Fun fact: The original lyrics Paul McCartney imagined for ‘Yesterday’ were ‘Scrambled eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs’.</em></p><p> You learn something new every day, right? Why not share that factoid with your viewers. Here a few facts to get you started:</p><p> Whales evolved from a land-based animal called a pakicetus.</p><p>The hagfish hunt by swimming into the mouth of a larger fish and eating it from the inside.</p><p>Crows live in family units, visit their aging parents, and have funerals for dead crows.</p><p>The puya chilensis is a plant that ‘eats’ sheep (sheep get stuck to it, starve, and end up as fertilizer).</p><p>Sea monkeys can survive in space.</p><h2 id="EVERYTHING-3"><a href="#EVERYTHING-3" class="headerlink" title="EVERYTHING"></a>EVERYTHING</h2><p>You could also just flick the camera on and tell the full story of your day like you’d do in a traditional daily blog. What did you have for breakfast, how was school&#x2F;work, did you talk to any friends, how was the weather – anything and everything. Generally, these videos can run a bit long and don’t have a lot of snappy editing. They’re faster to make, which is good if you’re doing them every day, but the unpolished nature of them won’t appeal to everyone.

Looking at channels that have millions of subscribers or videos that have God knows how many daily views may prompt you to start thinking about buying subscribers for your YouTube channel.</p><p>There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not this is a legitimate method of promoting the organic growth of your channel. A lot of people think buying subscribers and viewers is more damaging than it is helpful for YouTubers who opt to go down that road.</p><p>Before buying subscribers or views you first must make sure that the provider you’re considering doing business with is trustworthy. It may turn out that the service you purchased subscribers from is a scam designed to take your money. Besides being scammed, there are several other major concerns that make buying subscribers for your YouTube channel a questionable choice.</p><p>Let’s have a look at how buying subscribers may hurt your channel and ruin your chances of achieving YouTube success.</p><h2 id="The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned"><a href="#The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned" class="headerlink" title="The Odds of Getting Banned"></a>The Odds of Getting Banned</h2><p>If you’re considering buying subscribers, your most pressing question might be “Will I get banned?” This is completely within reason because your first concern should be to avoid being penalized by YouTube.</p><p>If YouTube’s algorithm catches you buying fake views, your video will be removed. We should specify that “fake views” means “views generated by a bot.”</p><p>Buying real human views is a bit of a grey area — not technically against the rules, but frowned upon and potentially risky if the delivery of the views results makes YouTube think you’re using a bot.</p><h4 id="What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views"><a href="#What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views" class="headerlink" title="What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views"></a>What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views</h4><p>If your video is removed for artificially inflating your view count you can try to restore it by filling out the <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168?hl=en" >YouTube View Abuse Appeal Form <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Even if you manage to restore your video, your channel will get a red flag — not the kind you get for copyright violation, but an internal one that keeps the YouTube’s algorithm alert in case you try to do the same thing again.</p><p>Being caught more than once gaming the system may result in your videos being permanently removed or your channel being completely suspended. When providers of views and subscribers advertise their services as safe they are actually saying that their service will not raise red flags with YouTube’s algorithm.</p><p>The only way in which they can guarantee that is if they intend on delivering high retention views, which means that actual people will click on your video and watch it from the beginning until the end. There are services that have proven to deliver this level of quality, and if you are interested you should check out <a href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>Buy Views Review</strong></a>, which is a site that tests and rates these services.</p><p>Buying subscribers is riskier than buying views, but there are still some services that are better than others.</p><h4 id="What-to-Consider-When-Buying-YouTube-Subscribers"><a href="#What-to-Consider-When-Buying-YouTube-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="What to Consider When Buying YouTube Subscribers"></a>What to Consider When Buying YouTube Subscribers</h4><p>While purchasing subscribers for a YouTube channel that doesn’t really make money is looked upon relatively lightly, buying views or subscribers to gain profit is an entirely different matter.</p><p>As you probably already know, YouTube videos are monetized through AdSense, which has far stricter rules about attempts to trick the system. Getting caught by AdSense may result in being banned from using AdSense, which means that your account will be suspended and you will not be allowed to open another account.</p><p>Buying fake views and subscribers to try and turn a profit involves a lot of risks, especially because the financial gain you will be able to make isn’t significant. There are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >other ways to make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than to get subscribers.</p><p>The best advice for YouTube creators who want to buy views and subscribers is to go through official channels. The reason for buying real views isn’t technically against the rules is because Google could be said to sell views itself through its ad services. Paying Google for YouTube views is highly unlikely to backfire on you, while you can also consider hiring freelancers to get you legitimate subscribers and views, the quality of their services can range from excellent to terrible and it will be hard to find reliable reviews.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1160850">                    <video width="576" height="324" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1160850">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1160850%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1160850/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Other-Risks-of-Buying-Subscribers"><a href="#Other-Risks-of-Buying-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Other Risks of Buying Subscribers"></a>Other Risks of Buying Subscribers</h2><p>Besides getting into trouble with YouTube, there are other risks involved with buying subscribers.</p><p>The whole idea behind buying fake subscribers is to make your channel look more popular to attract real subscribers, but in order to attract real subscribers, your videos need to rank in YouTube’s search engine. There are legitimate optimization tactics that can help you do that, but it does require more patience.</p><p>The amount of time viewers spend watching your video is the most important statistic for determining how well ranked your videos are in search queries on YouTube and if you buy fake views or fake subscribers, the viewer retention rates will remain the same.</p><h4 id="Why-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-Are-a-Waste-of-Money"><a href="#Why-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-Are-a-Waste-of-Money" class="headerlink" title="Why Fake YouTube Subscribers Are a Waste of Money"></a>Why Fake YouTube Subscribers Are a Waste of Money</h4><p>Buying fake subscribers won’t help get your videos in front of real viewers.</p><p>Your channel and your videos will continue to perform poorly in the search results as long as the viewer retention rates remain low. This is because buying subscribers doesn’t mean that you will be buying views or watch time.</p><p>In most cases, subscribers who you have paid for will not watch your videos. If your subscriber count suddenly shoots up, but your view count and watch time does not reflect that growth, YouTube’s algorithm will pick up on that. You may not face any official disciplinary action, but the algorithm will ensure that your videos are ranked very low in search results making it impossible to grow.</p><h4 id="Alternative-to-Buying-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers"><a href="#Alternative-to-Buying-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Alternative to Buying Fake YouTube Subscribers"></a>Alternative to Buying Fake YouTube Subscribers</h4><p>The best strategy is to grow your channel organically, even though it will take a lot of time. Create a community that loves and follows your work and you will never have to think about how to get fake subscribers.</p><p>If you would like to avoid even the slightest possibility of your channel getting hurt, create content that YouTube viewers will enjoy watching or find helpful, and keep making them consistently. It might take a long time, but you will start to see growth.</p><p>This is the best way to develop a loyal fan base that will help you get more subscribers. Views and subscribers you get from bot farms, which is where most of the bought subscribers and views come from, maybe excellent at imitating the human online behavior, but there will be consequences if you get caught.</p><p>Buying subscribers is unlikely to have a huge effect on the growth rate of your channel. Also, this method for increasing traffic on your channel will not take you a step closer to creating a community of subscribers who can’t wait to watch your next video, which should be the ultimate goal of every aspiring YouTube creator.</p><p>In conclusion, we don’t recommend that you buy fake YouTube subscribers.</p><h2 id="Make-Impressive-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora-to-Grow-Your-Subscriber"><a href="#Make-Impressive-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora-to-Grow-Your-Subscriber" class="headerlink" title="Make Impressive YouTube Video with Filmora to Grow Your Subscriber"></a>Make Impressive YouTube Video with Filmora to Grow Your Subscriber</h2><p>Since YouTube is a video platform, your video is what attracts your subscribers.

Conduct Keyword Research First</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-1.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - conduct keywords reseaerch first"                ></p><p>When it comes to YouTube SEO, keywords are crucial. YouTube uses these keywords to determine the subject of your video, index the content, and then associate it with what users are searching for. As such, you must add them to certain fields, including description, tags, and title, when you are uploading the video file. YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.</p><p>For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title"><a href="#2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="2. Use a Good Video Title"></a>2. Use a Good Video Title</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-2.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - video title"                ></p><p>The title of your video is the first thing other people see, and it’s what decides whether or not they watch it. Given how important it is, you’ll want to make sure that your title accurately reflects the content of your video and includes all relevant keywords.</p><h4 id="3-Link-Your-Videos-Directly-to-Your-Website"><a href="#3-Link-Your-Videos-Directly-to-Your-Website" class="headerlink" title="3. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website"></a>3. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website</h4><p>Each time you publish a new video, make sure you embed it on your website or blog. Not only will this encourage viewers to stay on your website instead of leaving immediately, but it will also make it easier for search engines crawlers to index your website.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Tags-To-The-Video-Description"><a href="#4-Add-Tags-To-The-Video-Description" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can do this by adding some relevant keywords with each tag like you would with blog posts.</p><p>When planning your strategy for YouTube keywords, you need to find 10-20 single keyword tags you want to rank for; keep in mind that this platform limits the number of tags users can include in a video. So you should first add the most relevant keyword phrases then include specific multi-word tags that will easily rank on top of search results.</p><h4 id="5-Edit-The-Filename"><a href="#5-Edit-The-Filename" class="headerlink" title="5. Edit The Filename"></a>5. Edit The Filename</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-4.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - edit the file name"                ></p><p>The filename of your video, or the “video URL,” can also affect its rankings. Including keywords in this section will help the crawlers index your video faster, which will increase its chances of ranking higher.</p><h4 id="6-Add-Subtitles-and-Closed-Captions"><a href="#6-Add-Subtitles-and-Closed-Captions" class="headerlink" title="6. Add Subtitles and Closed Captions"></a>6. Add Subtitles and Closed Captions</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-5.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - add subtitles and closed captions"                ></p><p>Adding subtitles and closed captions to your videos is also a good idea, especially if you want the video’s ranking and viewership to improve. Subtitles make it easier for new viewers to understand your videos, especially if your audience comes from different linguistic backgrounds.</p><h4 id="7-Select-Video-Category"><a href="#7-Select-Video-Category" class="headerlink" title="7. Select Video Category"></a>7. Select Video Category</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-6.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - select video category"                ></p><p>When uploading a video, be sure to select the most appropriate category for it. Essentially, this helps with SEO optimization because choosing the right category means that YouTube’s algorithm will place your video in the proper search results. In turn, viewers will easily find your video and watch it.</p><h4 id="8-Use-a-Compelling-Thumbnail"><a href="#8-Use-a-Compelling-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="8.

You might want to use high-quality, high-contrast images with a 16:9 aspect ratio. YouTube will choose which frame it will display as the video thumbnail. The platform will present three screenshots that you can choose from; however, you can upload your image or select a shot of another moment in the video.</p><p>Remember that YouTube overlays the duration of the video in the corner of your thumbnail. So make sure it does not obstruct any relevant details in your thumbnail. Google also uses image recognition to filter out specific imagery, including the YouTube logo.</p><p>Ideally, you need an image that is a perfect visual representation of the keywords you are targeting. In turn, this is going to take your presence in relevant search results even further.</p><h4 id="9-Make-High-Quality-Longer"><a href="#9-Make-High-Quality-Longer" class="headerlink" title="9. Make High-Quality Longer"></a>9. Make High-Quality Longer</h4><p>Videos that are less than 2 minutes long often rank low. The duration of most of the videos in the first five positions is usually 11 minutes 44 seconds. Therefore, you need to invest in longer videos that are around 10 minutes long. These videos meet the expectations of many users seeking complete and in-depth content. Additionally, you should create high-quality videos to ensure your viewers will keep watching.</p><h4 id="Create-High-Quality-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Create-High-Quality-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Create High-Quality YouTube Video with Filmora"></a>Create High-Quality YouTube Video with Filmora</h4><p>Wondershare’s Filmora program allows you to edit your video content with trim, transitions, and overlays.

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus.

The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em> |<br>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                >         | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |<br>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                > | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em>                                                                                                                             |</p><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging.

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead></table><p>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                >       | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em> |<br>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                >         | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |</p><p>| <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                > | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em>                                                                                                                             |</p><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

The look is highly inspirational in itself. The vintage effect in photography and videos results in a must-see look that everyone wants to capture all day long. The meaning of vintage is ‘the time when something of quality was produced.’ When something is called retro, it means old, recognized, and essential. Vintage also resembles love apart from videos and photos. All in all, it’s a positive and result-oriented thing to carry on in your videos. And this is what we want to mention in this post relating to the creation of vintage videos.</p><p>Here are some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >vintage-style video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you to have a look at.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What to Consider When Shooting a Vintage Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-to-Consider-When-Shooting-a-Vintage-Video"><a href="#What-to-Consider-When-Shooting-a-Vintage-Video" class="headerlink" title="What to Consider When Shooting a Vintage Video?"></a>What to Consider When Shooting a Vintage Video?</h2><p>Vintage videos are kind of old school vibes and must be shooting accordingly by keeping in mind the following points. These are a sort of expert tips given by photographers based on their practical experience. First of all, you have to understand that a video can be made vintage, but you can’t change the actual environment of shooting. Some editing always involves there in every project out there. Still, the tips given below will help you a lot in creating a retro look.</p><h4 id="Use-Vintage-Lenses"><a href="#Use-Vintage-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Use Vintage Lenses"></a>Use Vintage Lenses</h4><p>The very first helpful tip is to use a vintage lens. They allow chromatic aberration by distorting colors around the frame. Furthermore, you can find various kinds of lenses in terms of a vintage effect.</p><h4 id="Decrease-Contrast"><a href="#Decrease-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="Decrease Contrast"></a>Decrease Contrast</h4><p>Do the correct color grading by reducing the contrast a little bit. You must not level the retro videos in black or white or like-new videos. You can simply add a contrasting effect and then reduce it to have that vintage look.</p><h4 id="Keep-it-a-little-soft"><a href="#Keep-it-a-little-soft" class="headerlink" title="Keep it a little soft"></a>Keep it a little soft</h4><p>If you have ever noticed, the vintage videos are a little soft and look like degraded with time. It’s a result of decreased sharpness in the camera’s menu settings. You can even add a slight blur to the final video or simply use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >recognized software made for video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Brighten-up-the-black-levels"><a href="#Brighten-up-the-black-levels" class="headerlink" title="Brighten up the black levels"></a>Brighten up the black levels</h4><p>Lots of black points in the video are not ideal for a vintage effect. The suitable approach is to bring up black levels and make it dark gray instead of inky black. This look can be achieved either by levels effect or curves effect in your editing software.</p><h4 id="Reduce-Saturation-levels"><a href="#Reduce-Saturation-levels" class="headerlink" title="Reduce Saturation levels"></a>Reduce Saturation levels</h4><p>Bringing down the saturation levels is another tip to create a vintage effect. The old videos are also absent in bright colors. Don’t go too crazy about reduction as 20%-30% saturation level is more than enough.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Stunning-Vintage-Video"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Stunning-Vintage-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?"></a>How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?</h2><p>What you need to get started as both beginner and professional is Wondershare Filmora Video Editor.

Adjust them in the timeline as per your requirements.</p><p>After doing all the essential editing functions, click on the <strong>Effects tab</strong> given at the upper-left corner. Simply type the word Old in the Search tab.</p><p>The Old Video filter will immediately appear in the list of filters. Tap the <strong>“+”</strong> icon in Old Video filter to add to the timeline. Drag its ends right or left to adjust the duration.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Apply White &amp; Black Filters</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-2.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>The second step is to apply the Black &amp; White filters. Go to the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and explore five Black &amp; White filters available. Each of these filters is quite different and must be applied accordingly. Check the aesthetic of your video clip before any filter application to retro videos.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the Sun Kissed or Sepia Tone Rise Filters to the video clip</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-3.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>There are various other categories of filters you can apply, such as Retro, Sun Kissed, and Sepia Tone, etc. The features of Filmora also present several subcategories such as Faux Film or Shake.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-4.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>On the other hand, the subcategory of Sepia Tone features Sun-Kissed &amp; Rise Filters to stimulate sepia-tinted texture and recreate the old visual style. The Sun Kissed filter presents brown and red colors to give that warm image atmosphere.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Desaturate Video Clip</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-5.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>Now, you need to desaturate the video clip with Ash &amp; Willow filters. We have typed Ash in the Search bar, and you can see the filter below. These filters are essential to desaturate the video with preset contrast, brightness, or exposure values.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-6.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>Then, we have combined the black &amp; white filter with an overlay of Film Reel Horizontal. It will help you sell the effect and make the video look more authentic. However, the only application of Black &amp; White or Ash &amp; Willow filters is not going to make any creative thing in terms of vintage videos. You have to mix overlays with features such as Random Dust or Film Reel Horizontal.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Apply Black &amp; White and Old Film Color Correction Presets to the video</p><p>You can also access the Advanced color correction Tab of Filmora from the Color button. It also features Preset and Adjusts Tabs to desaturate footage. The Preset presents a variety of options, including Black &amp; White and Old Film. You just need to right-click the particular preset and select the Apply option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-advance-color-correction.jpg"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><h2 id="Tips-to-Make-Your-Vintage-Videos-Stand-Out"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-Your-Vintage-Videos-Stand-Out" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out"></a>Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out</h2><p>Following the helpful tips would assist you in creating awesome retro videos.</p><ul><li>You can use various vintage apps such as <strong>Retro VHS</strong>, <strong>RTRO Camera</strong>, <strong>8mm</strong>, <strong>Camcorder</strong>, <strong>VSCO</strong>, etc. Or, despite using these limited apps, you can directly use our preferred video editing software called <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>.</li><li>If you use a specific vintage camera, keep it on low highlights and low contrasts. Use color grading, as we have discussed above. They help to provide the ultimate old-school effect.</li><li>Always keep low saturation settings for shooting vintage videos. Take control over Saturation, Hue, and <strong>Luminance</strong> of video.</li><li>Add overlays and respective filters to recreate a required vintage look. You must add things that dust, scratch, and grain the heck out from the video that you have created.</li><li>Lower the frame rate or FPS to create an excellent vintage look. You can make it to 18 or 14 FPS depending upon the aesthetic requirements.</li><li>Keep an eye on black and white filters you have used. It’s because more of a black and white can ruin the actual vintage experience.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983575">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983575.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983575">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983575.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983575%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983575/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>So, this is an ultimate tutorial on the creation of vintage videos.

When you’re a YouTube creator, you should definitely take advantage of this desire and use a YouTube background video designed specifically with this in mind.</p><p>In this guide, we’ll go over how to get or make such a background and show you five incredible examples you can use now.</p><p><strong>YouTube Video Background</strong> Creating realistic video scenes at your will is easy to complete with Filmora green screen removal.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn Green Screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="What-Is-a-YouTube-Video-Background"><a href="#What-Is-a-YouTube-Video-Background" class="headerlink" title="What Is a YouTube Video Background?"></a>What Is a YouTube Video Background?</h2><p>A <strong>YouTube video background</strong> is a simple image or video that sits in place at the back of your videos. It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.</p><p>Even something as small as your <strong>YouTube video thumbnail background</strong> can strongly impact your results.</p><p>Obviously, choosing the right <strong>custom YouTube background</strong> is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.</p><h2 id="Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective"><a href="#Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?"></a>Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?</h2><p>There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.</p><p>The main reasons include:</p><ul><li>Creates a meaningful connection;</li><li>Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;</li><li>Builds a better brand;</li><li>Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.</li></ul><p>So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal <strong>YouTube video background download</strong>.</p><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos"></a>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.</p><h3 id="Content-Relevance"><a href="#Content-Relevance" class="headerlink" title="Content Relevance"></a>Content Relevance</h3><p>As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="Audience-Appeal"><a href="#Audience-Appeal" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.</p><h3 id="Lighting-and-Visibility"><a href="#Lighting-and-Visibility" class="headerlink" title="Lighting and Visibility"></a>Lighting and Visibility</h3><p>Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><h3 id="Personal-Branding"><a href="#Personal-Branding" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background.

It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.</p><p>Even something as small as your <strong>YouTube video thumbnail background</strong> can strongly impact your results.</p><p>Obviously, choosing the right <strong>custom YouTube background</strong> is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.</p><h2 id="Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective-1"><a href="#Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?"></a>Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?</h2><p>There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.</p><p>The main reasons include:</p><ul><li>Creates a meaningful connection;</li><li>Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;</li><li>Builds a better brand;</li><li>Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.</li></ul><p>So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal <strong>YouTube video background download</strong>.</p><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos-1"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos"></a>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.</p><h3 id="Content-Relevance-1"><a href="#Content-Relevance-1" class="headerlink" title="Content Relevance"></a>Content Relevance</h3><p>As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="Audience-Appeal-1"><a href="#Audience-Appeal-1" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like.

Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><h3 id="Personal-Branding-1"><a href="#Personal-Branding-1" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background.

However, it doesn’t end at adding tags; you need to know more. Be savvy to put the tags strategically depending on your topic’s trending. So, why add a tag to YouTube videos? You want to gain enough clicks, yes, right? And that’s what hashtags do. They are online content features that will push the number of clicks to an unimaginable level.</p><p>Your content will gain more views and go viral within a short time.

This YouTube channel has over 29 million subscribers, and it’s believed to be among the fastest-growing channels in India.

This article discusses everything you need to know about the young YouTube gamer, from his monthly and yearly payments to his net worth.</p><p><strong>Meta Description</strong>: This article discusses the brains behind the popular Techno Gamerz YouTube channel. You’ll learn about the Techno Gamerz income, age, gender, nationality, and more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Techno-Gamerz"><a href="#Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Techno-Gamerz" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Summary Box on Techno Gamerz"></a>Part 1: Summary Box on Techno Gamerz</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Ujjwal Chaurasia</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Net worth in USD (2022)</td><td>$2 million</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly income and salary</td><td>RS.15 Lakh+</td></tr><tr><td>Yearly income and salary</td><td>1.5 Crore</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>20 years (born January 12, 2002)</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Indian</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5.5 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>YouTuber</td></tr><tr><td>YouTube channel</td><td>Techno Gamerz</td></tr><tr><td>Awards and recognition</td><td>Diamond, Gold, and Silver play buttons</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Up to this point, you should have a brief overview of who Techno Gamerz is and what he does to earn such staggering figures on YouTube. So, the next section discusses his income in detail and what makes this YouTuber so famous. Keep reading!</p><h2 id="Part-2-Techno-Gamerz-YouTube-Earning-and-Stats"><a href="#Part-2-Techno-Gamerz-YouTube-Earning-and-Stats" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Techno Gamerz YouTube Earning and Stats"></a>Part 2: Techno Gamerz YouTube Earning and Stats</h2><p>Ujjwal Chaurasia, alias Techno Gamerz, was born and grew up in New Delhi, India. The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother’s phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz youtube marketing"                ></p><p>But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel’s profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.</p><p>Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It’s simple; via AdSense! YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you’ll earn at least $1,500. <strong>Techno Gamerz YouTube income</strong> per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.</p><p>Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That’s not all; you’ll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube’s payroll.</p><p>With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the <strong>Techno Gamerz monthly income</strong>, number of views, and more:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Estimated Monthly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</th><th>$167K</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Estimated Yearly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</td><td>$8.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total video uploads</td><td>858</td></tr><tr><td>Type of videos</td><td>Gaming tutorials</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>29 million</td></tr><tr><td>Video views</td><td>7.5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 days’ views</td><td>7 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram. Here, the 20-year-old has more than 2 million followers and over 250K likes on “ujjwalgamer.” He usually posts selfies, pictures, and a few gaming contents on Instagram. Ujjwal’s engagement rate on Instagram is around 12.5%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-3.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz instagram"                ></p><p>He also has another Instagram account called “<a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/techno%5Fgamerz/" >Techno_Gamerz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>,” which has over 1M followers and over 120K likes. Ujjwal uses this account to keep his followers abreast of what’s happening on his YouTube channel and give hints of future releases. He also posts subscriber milestones. His Twitter account is “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/UjjwalGamer" >Ujjwal Chaurasia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>,” with over 116K followers and around 290 posts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-4.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz instagram and twitter homepage"                ></p><p>Ujjwal is also venturing into music lately, specifically Hip Hop. He partnered with one of India’s most prominent producers, Sez on the Beat, to release Game On. This music tells a tale of how Chaurasia started from zero subscribers to more than 10 million. Currently, this single boasts over 62 million views.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Why-Is-Techno-Gamerz-Trending-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-3-Why-Is-Techno-Gamerz-Trending-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why Is Techno Gamerz Trending on YouTube?"></a>Part 3: Why Is Techno Gamerz Trending on YouTube?</h2><p>The <strong>Techno Gamerz earnings</strong> are certainly no fluke.

He even admitted in an interview that it’s critical for his audience to follow the storyline, making watching series like GTA V more interesting.</p><p><strong>3. Single and multiplayer tutorials</strong></p><p>Techno Gamerz’s tutorials consist of single and multiplayer games. He says that single-player games bring out his character’s awesomely powerful and superior side. He also admitted that he loves multiplayer games’ unpredictable and challenging nature.</p><p><strong>Something about Techno Gamerz’s most loved videos</strong></p><p>As said before, Dragon Ball Z was the YouTuber’s first upload on the platform. Then in January 2018, he went ahead to upload PUBG videos, but his breakthrough came when he switched to GTA. Up to now, he has posted 140+ GTA 5 episodes, which are famous for their unique storylines. Interestingly, each of his GTA videos has 5+ million views.</p><p>But to be one of the most popular YouTubers, you’ll need diversity. Techno Gamerz has this in abundance. His “Grandpa and Granny Two Hunters” video has 10+ million views. It’s a horror game where Techno Gamerz plays the scary granny with insane tricks.</p><p>His other videos, “BeamNG” and “Just Draw,” have more than 12 million and 13 million views, respectively.

YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you’ll earn at least $1,500. <strong>Techno Gamerz YouTube income</strong> per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.</p><p>Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That’s not all; you’ll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube’s payroll.</p><p>With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the <strong>Techno Gamerz monthly income</strong>, number of views, and more:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Estimated Monthly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</th><th>$167K</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Estimated Yearly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</td><td>$8.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total video uploads</td><td>858</td></tr><tr><td>Type of videos</td><td>Gaming tutorials</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>29 million</td></tr><tr><td>Video views</td><td>7.5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 days’ views</td><td>7 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram.
