Thumbnails will help viewers decide to watch your videos, and a personalized banner will tell people who you are and what your vlog is about. Watermarks both label your work as yours and protect it from theft. Your icon is the avatar you will use to communicate with your subscribers. You can totally change the look and feel of the page and the changes will carry forwards for the page display on all platforms. However, the elements might look slightly different on desktops, mobile devices, and TV screens.</p><h4 id="1-Banner"><a href="#1-Banner" class="headerlink" title="1. Banner"></a>1. Banner</h4><p>A banner sits at the top of your channel, welcoming viewers to your videos and promoting your brand. Having your brand front and center here is a great plan, as it gives people confidence in who they are watching, as well as raising your brand profile on the platform.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><strong>Size</strong>: 2560x1440px recommended.

Icon or logo</h4><p>If you’re building a brand on YouTube, you should absolutely have a recognizable logo or, at least, an icon that is unique to you. This way you’ll start to be recognized whenever people stumble across your footage, even if it’s on another platform such as Facebook.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> 800x800px recommended.

If you don’t plan this from the start, then all the effort you put into designing your channel art will be wasted, as it will either not display properly or will just look terrible. YouTube has provided these guidelines for channel art designs:</p><ul><li>The file size must not exceed 6MB</li><li>The image should ideally be 2560 x 1440 pixels</li><li>The minimum image size is 2048 x 1152 pixels</li><li>The maximum width is 2560 x 423 pixels</li></ul><p><strong>The ideal dimensions for different devices are listed below:</strong></p><ul><li>Mobile:1546px * 423px</li><li>Tablet :1855px * 423px</li><li>Desktop:2560px * 423px</li><li>TV:2560px * 1440px</li></ul><p>You see, YouTube channel art 2560*1440 px is ideal for TV devices. If you’re not sure about the width and height of the channel art image, you can download the <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2972003?hl=en" >Channel Art Templates from YouTube Official Site <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to check.</p><p>Keeping in mind people will access your channel on a variety of screen sizes, you’re going to need to design channel art that fits within these proportions and displays correctly no matter how it’s viewed. Use the ‘safe area’ displayed on YouTube to ensure your logo and branding is correct on every screen size.</p><h3 id="Part-3-Why-should-you-care-about-channel-art"><a href="#Part-3-Why-should-you-care-about-channel-art" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why should you care about channel art?"></a>Part 3: Why should you care about channel art?</h3><p>If you’re wondering if you should really be bothered about channel art, the answer is you absolutely should. Channel art is all about branding, and in today’s cluttered web world, having a strong, recognizable brand is crucial. Rather than simply having a place to upload some videos, your YouTube channel can become a powerful marketing tool for promoting your brand and values.</p><p>According to research, we are a highly visual species. 65 percent of people learn better visually, and when you’re thinking about retaining information, 90 percent of what we store in our brains is visual information.

Tips for Making Thumbnails"></a>1. Tips for Making Thumbnails</h4><p>A thumbnail is an image that represents your video in YouTube’s search results. There are things you can do with your thumbnail that will make it more likely to get clicked on. Always upload your own thumbnail rather than relying on the one YouTube automatically chooses, and make sure the thumbnail you use is related to the content of your video.</p><p>One of the most important things to remember is that thumbnails are small. It is better if there is not a lot going on in them because details will be hard to see. If there is any text in your thumbnail make sure it is huge so that people can still read it once it has been shrunken down.</p><p>If you are making a thumbnail for a vlog entry then choose a shot that has you in it, particularly one where you are not too far away from the camera. It is also a good idea if the thumbnails for your vlog entries all look similar so it is easy for people browsing to recognize which videos are yours.</p><h4 id="2-Tips-for-Making-Watermarks"><a href="#2-Tips-for-Making-Watermarks" class="headerlink" title="2. Tips for Making Watermarks"></a>2. Tips for Making Watermarks</h4><p>Watermarks work best when they are small and transparent so they do not distract viewers from your videos. If your watermark is colored, there should not be more than one or two colors. Unlike the full version of your logo, you do not want your watermark to be overly eye-catching.</p><h4 id="3-Tips-for-Making-Icons"><a href="#3-Tips-for-Making-Icons" class="headerlink" title="3. Tips for Making Icons"></a>3. Tips for Making Icons</h4><p>Watermarks work best when they are small and transparent so they do not distract viewers from your videos.

With some of the easy-to-use, powerful tools that are available out there, you can make some beautiful, professional-looking channel art in no time at all. Here are six of our favorite tools for creating amazing youtube channel art:</p><h4 id="1-Photoshop"><a href="#1-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="1. Photoshop"></a>1. Photoshop</h4><p>Produced by Adobe, Photoshop has been leading the way in professional design software for many years. When it comes to creating logos, banners, editing photos and more, nothing really comes close to the power of this software. While the professional version of Photoshop can set you back several hundreds of dollars, Photoshop Elements is much more affordable at around the $100 mark, and has enough functionality to do most things you’d need for your channel art.</p><p>New from Adobe is Adobe Spark Post, a free-to-use <a class="link"   href="https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker" >web and iOS app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which has been specifically designed to help you create beautiful channel art. Although it can only provide basic channel art without much in the way of editing tools, if you’re new to graphic design and want a free, user-friendly way to create your art, this could be worth considering.</p><h4 id="2-Wondershare-PixStudio"><a href="#2-Wondershare-PixStudio" class="headerlink" title="2. Wondershare PixStudio"></a>2. Wondershare PixStudio</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-tools-to-create-channel-art.jpg"                      alt="YouTube channel art maker - PixStudio"                ></p><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform provides a wonderful creative design solution for you. Just through drag and drop templates, and then use photos&#x2F;text&#x2F;elements to design. After the simple and fast design, One-Click to download your creations, and share to your Facebook, Instagram Story, and YouTube Thumbnails, etc. immediately.</p><p>This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.</p><h4 id="3-Fotor"><a href="#3-Fotor" class="headerlink" title="3. Fotor"></a>3. Fotor</h4><p>For a good, user-friendly way to create professional-looking YouTube channel art, Fotor is a pretty solid choice. Using a simple drag and drop interface, users can create a unique channel banner using preset designs or even uploading their own artwork.</p><p>The developers of Fotor have built in a bespoke banner maker, preset to the exact size required for YouTube channel art. This makes it easier than ever to ensure you develop excellent channel art which will display correctly on any device. Editing is limited, so advanced designers will probably find it all a bit too simplistic, but for the man on the street, this is a perfect choice.</p><h4 id="4-Canva"><a href="#4-Canva" class="headerlink" title="4. Canva"></a>4. Canva</h4><p>Canva really stands out from the competition for the number of customizable design elements present on the website. From shapes to backgrounds, images to text, there are thousands of awesome, professional-looking elements to choose from to create your unique channel art.</p><p>Similar to Fotor, those who know what they’re doing in the design field will find it lacking in functionality, and there’s an irritating glitch where you can’t stretch more than one image to the ends of the canvas. Watch out for premium design elements too, as lots require payment, although usually not more than a dollar or two.</p><h4 id="5-PicMonkey"><a href="#5-PicMonkey" class="headerlink" title="5. PicMonkey"></a>5. PicMonkey</h4><p>For a good middle ground between expensive but powerful Photoshop and free but limited options like Canva and Fotor, PicMonkey is a great solution. It has plenty of design functionality, from working with layers to performing tasks like blending, and you can free draw and erase parts of your image too.</p><p>We found PicMonkey capable of pretty much everything you’d need to create a professional YouTube banner, and it’s a fair bit more user friendly than Photoshop too. It’s not free, but at a cost of $7.99 per month, it’s pretty affordable for what you get.</p><h4 id="6-Snappa"><a href="#6-Snappa" class="headerlink" title="6. Snappa"></a>6. Snappa</h4><p>Another web-based freemium service, Snappa has the added advantage of coming pre-loaded with all the dimensions of popular social channel’s banners, profile images and more, including YouTube. That means you can work on your channel art directly, seeing clearly which parts will be displayed on what devices.</p><p>The drawback to this particular platform is the sheer volume of stock images already on the site. There are some nice ones, but due to the lack of organization you need to scroll through quite a few mediocre options to find them. There’s also a fairly ungenerous limit on how many items you can create and save without upgrading, but the pro version is fairly affordable at just $10 a month.</p><p>There are many other services out there to help you create your YouTube channel art and what’s best for you will depend on the type of channel art you’re looking to create, as well as your own abilities with graphic design.

Have a Consistent Layout"></a>1. Have a Consistent Layout</h2><p>Your thumbnails all must look like part of the same set. You want viewers to recognize your videos like yours, and they are more likely to do that if you build up a standard layout that they can start associating with you.</p><p>An example of a standard layout could be you in the middle of the screen wearing an expression that matches the theme of your video, with your title written underneath your face. Every individual thumbnail would still be different, but you and the text would always be in the same spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consistent-layout.jpg"                      alt="Consistent Layout"                ></p><h2 id="2-Use-Your-Face"><a href="#2-Use-Your-Face" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Your Face"></a><strong>2. Use Your Face</strong></h2><p>People feel automatically connected and drawn into images that make eye contact. This makes thumbnails which feature faces more click-able than thumbnails which don’t, in most genres (i.e. if you make food videos then this may not apply – featuring the food might be more important than featuring your face). <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out more tips like this here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Also, if somebody recognizes you in your thumbnail from a previous video of yours, that will go a long way towards making them click.</p><h2 id="3-Use-Graphics-Emojis-that-are-On-Topic"><a href="#3-Use-Graphics-Emojis-that-are-On-Topic" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic"></a>3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic</h2><p>Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail. To make your thumbnails look polished, consider using small images (like emojis or hearts) to stand out. This will add color and personality to your thumbnail.</p><p>Make sure the images you choose are relevant to the topic of your video.</p><h2 id="4-Make-Your-Text-Huge"><a href="#4-Make-Your-Text-Huge" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Your Text Huge"></a>4. Make Your Text Huge</h2><p>If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.</p><p>Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144299/7443" target="_top" id="2144299">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144299" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144299/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free"><a href="#5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep it Clutter-Free"></a>5. Keep it Clutter-Free</h2><p>It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much.

So if you are a cooking aficionado, you have excellent potential to gain positive attention and a loyal audience. But to create engaging videos, you’d need a lot more than excellent culinary skills. This article aims to enlighten aspiring food and recipe vloggers about the essentials of video making straight out of the oven, to create enriched content that’s professional, neat, and viral-worthy.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What to Prepare Before Making a Recipe Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Make a Cooking Video with Filmora: a Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Tips to Make Your Cooking Videos Stand Out</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Promote Your Cooking Channel on YouTube?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-to-Prepare-Before-Making-a-Recipe-Video"><a href="#What-to-Prepare-Before-Making-a-Recipe-Video" class="headerlink" title="What to Prepare Before Making a Recipe Video"></a>What to Prepare Before Making a Recipe Video</h2><p>While you would know best about the prep work needed for the recipes, the prep work for making a video starts with a plan. What goes into the plan?</p><p>Brainstorm this equation - <strong>Main Content + Duration + Light + Sound + Camera + Camera Angle, Shots &amp; Transition</strong>.</p><p><strong>The main content is how you picture the finished video</strong>. Ask yourself - Do you want an intro gig? Are you going to talk in the video or show only hands and the cooking with a piece of background music? How do you wish to present the ingredients? Would there be additional tips? At what platform are you going to publish your content? How long should be your clippings? Consider all these questions to chalk out a basic framework of your video</p><p><strong>The camera is a pivotal element</strong>. Whether it is a smartphone or a hi-fidelity digital camera, it is worthwhile to familiarise the best positions and light orientations and the capacity of the device to produce the best quality picture.</p><p><strong>How is your sound going to be like?</strong> If you are going to talk in the video, it is recommended that you use a microphone. Or else, you can also use background sound. But to mix sound with the video, you’d need an excellent sound editing tool.</p><p>Finally, comes the editing and finishing part. Eventually, you’ll need purposive video-editing software to help you work out the video transitions, sound, and visual effects.<strong>Choose a toolkit that is easy to learn</strong> and that you can get comfortable with so that the job of video editing doesn’t take the focus away from the main task of cooking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recipe-videos.jpg"                      alt="Recipe Videos"                ></p><p>Now, once you have all the essential ingredients to create your video, start practicing. Remember that it is the most natural thing for the first videos to appear amateurish or inept. And that is part of the plan. Don’t be disheartened and keep going.</p><h2 id="Make-a-Cooking-Video-with-Filmora-a-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#Make-a-Cooking-Video-with-Filmora-a-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Make a Cooking Video with Filmora: a Step-by-Step Guide"></a>Make a Cooking Video with Filmora: a Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>As one of the easiest-to-use video editing tools, the full-featured Filmora is the right choice considering it can fit most of your needs. Moreover, you’d be delighted to know that the software also has a series of features and functions and even tutorial videos dedicated to cooking videos.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="Step-1-Filming-the-Video"><a href="#Step-1-Filming-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Filming the Video"></a>Step 1: Filming the Video</h4><p>Whether you are going to present a traditional cook-with-me style video or feature the contemporary “jump-cut” style focusing on speedy short videos, you need to prepare all the equipment and ingredients to suit the frame by frame shots. Consider spills, drops, overcooking, etc. as part of the process, so keep adequate substitutes to continue with your project unwaveringly. If you are using a phone, keep it fully charged up. And have a plan beforehand about what you should do when you get an urgent call while shooting. Also, consider doing a site investigation of the shooting spot for any fragile items, pointy corners, slippery areas, curious pets, etc. to avoid trips and falls in the middle of the filming, especially when working with a cameraman who’s following your movement. If you are using a tripod, and floor-standing lights, remember to secure the equipment with plenty of adhesive tapes, lest they bump into an expensive trip or fall.</p><h4 id="Step-2-mport-Your-Video-In-Filmora"><a href="#Step-2-mport-Your-Video-In-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: mport Your Video In Filmora"></a>Step 2: mport Your Video In Filmora</h4><p>You need to sync the device that you used to film the video with the computer that has Filmora installed. It may be a phone or a camcorder. Once the devices are synced, you should launch the Filmora software and go the <strong>“Media”</strong> button at the top right toolbar. There you will find the <strong>“Import”</strong> button. You will get a pop-up message asking you to choose the type of device. Select the right one, and your video will be imported in the Filmora interface.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Edit-Video-Pace-Time-Lapse-Jump-Cut-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Step-3-Edit-Video-Pace-Time-Lapse-Jump-Cut-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Edit Video Pace: Time-Lapse, Jump Cut, Slow Motion"></a>Step 3: Edit Video Pace: Time-Lapse, Jump Cut, Slow Motion</h4><p>To create crisp, fast-paced videos, you don’t have to gobble up the content eyeing at the duration. Think smart when you have the resources of a tool like Filmora. Here are the three best features that help you create fast-paced yet well-defined recipes.</p><p><strong>Time-Lapse:</strong> The time-lapse feature allows you to adjust the speed of the video from slow-motion to 10x faster. To use this, double click on a specific clip in your imported video and open the custom speed settings. Use the adjusting meter beside speed to make your clip as fast or slow as you want. You may use the same feature to introduce the slow-motion effects in certain areas of the video.</p><p>Now, when you are using either the fast-forward or slow-motion effects, it is best to have stable video footage with consistent lighting and a static background. There are also the options of Reverse Speed that can play the clip backward, as in flash-back. The Ripple edit feature allows you to cut short a long clip seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Jump Cut:</strong> The Jump Cut is about snipping unwanted areas in the clip. It may sound like the Ripple edit mentioned above, but the ripple edit is more functional for cutting short a continuous video so that the viewer won’t realize the snip. For the Jump Cut, it doesn’t have to be a constant clip. You can get to the next frame or scene with an abracadabra move.</p><p>To use Jump Cut, place the cursor over the starting of the clip that you want to cut, and right-click on it and select <strong>“Split”</strong> (the <strong>“scissors”</strong> feature on the toolbar does the same thing). To make this look neat, preview the portion of the clip once again and delete the cuts between two clips with the same right-click.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora"><a href="#Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora"></a>Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora</h4><p>Transitions make your video more interactive and help you segregate the video from frame-to-frame with effects like dissolve, fade, flash, etc. there are numerous transition options available within the Filmora suit.</p><p>The best way to do this drag and drop the clips on the timeline is to trim parts of the clip to shorten it. Once you have all the clips in place, go to the <strong>“Transitions”</strong> options at the top toolbar to apply it on the end or start of each clip.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Audio-Playback-Sound-Edits"><a href="#Step-5-Audio-Playback-Sound-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Audio, Playback &amp; Sound Edits"></a>Step 5: Audio, Playback &amp; Sound Edits</h4><p>There are plenty of options that you can remove background noise, add voiceover, add music, and detach audio from video. Refer to the Audios section from your toolbar.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Save-to-Drive-Emport-Publish"><a href="#Step-6-Save-to-Drive-Emport-Publish" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Save to Drive&#x2F; Emport&#x2F; Publish"></a>Step 6: Save to Drive&#x2F; Emport&#x2F; Publish</h4><p>Once you are satisfied with your content, then go to Export.

To use this, double click on a specific clip in your imported video and open the custom speed settings. Use the adjusting meter beside speed to make your clip as fast or slow as you want. You may use the same feature to introduce the slow-motion effects in certain areas of the video.</p><p>Now, when you are using either the fast-forward or slow-motion effects, it is best to have stable video footage with consistent lighting and a static background. There are also the options of Reverse Speed that can play the clip backward, as in flash-back. The Ripple edit feature allows you to cut short a long clip seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Jump Cut:</strong> The Jump Cut is about snipping unwanted areas in the clip. It may sound like the Ripple edit mentioned above, but the ripple edit is more functional for cutting short a continuous video so that the viewer won’t realize the snip. For the Jump Cut, it doesn’t have to be a constant clip. You can get to the next frame or scene with an abracadabra move.</p><p>To use Jump Cut, place the cursor over the starting of the clip that you want to cut, and right-click on it and select <strong>“Split”</strong> (the <strong>“scissors”</strong> feature on the toolbar does the same thing). To make this look neat, preview the portion of the clip once again and delete the cuts between two clips with the same right-click.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora-1"><a href="#Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora"></a>Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora</h4><p>Transitions make your video more interactive and help you segregate the video from frame-to-frame with effects like dissolve, fade, flash, etc. there are numerous transition options available within the Filmora suit.</p><p>The best way to do this drag and drop the clips on the timeline is to trim parts of the clip to shorten it.

So if you are a cooking aficionado, you have excellent potential to gain positive attention and a loyal audience. But to create engaging videos, you’d need a lot more than excellent culinary skills.

What goes into the plan?</p><p>Brainstorm this equation - <strong>Main Content + Duration + Light + Sound + Camera + Camera Angle, Shots &amp; Transition</strong>.</p><p><strong>The main content is how you picture the finished video</strong>. Ask yourself - Do you want an intro gig? Are you going to talk in the video or show only hands and the cooking with a piece of background music? How do you wish to present the ingredients? Would there be additional tips? At what platform are you going to publish your content? How long should be your clippings? Consider all these questions to chalk out a basic framework of your video</p><p><strong>The camera is a pivotal element</strong>. Whether it is a smartphone or a hi-fidelity digital camera, it is worthwhile to familiarise the best positions and light orientations and the capacity of the device to produce the best quality picture.</p><p><strong>How is your sound going to be like?</strong> If you are going to talk in the video, it is recommended that you use a microphone. Or else, you can also use background sound. But to mix sound with the video, you’d need an excellent sound editing tool.</p><p>Finally, comes the editing and finishing part. Eventually, you’ll need purposive video-editing software to help you work out the video transitions, sound, and visual effects.<strong>Choose a toolkit that is easy to learn</strong> and that you can get comfortable with so that the job of video editing doesn’t take the focus away from the main task of cooking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recipe-videos.jpg"                      alt="Recipe Videos"                ></p><p>Now, once you have all the essential ingredients to create your video, start practicing.

Consider spills, drops, overcooking, etc. as part of the process, so keep adequate substitutes to continue with your project unwaveringly. If you are using a phone, keep it fully charged up. And have a plan beforehand about what you should do when you get an urgent call while shooting. Also, consider doing a site investigation of the shooting spot for any fragile items, pointy corners, slippery areas, curious pets, etc. to avoid trips and falls in the middle of the filming, especially when working with a cameraman who’s following your movement. If you are using a tripod, and floor-standing lights, remember to secure the equipment with plenty of adhesive tapes, lest they bump into an expensive trip or fall.</p><h4 id="Step-2-mport-Your-Video-In-Filmora-3"><a href="#Step-2-mport-Your-Video-In-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: mport Your Video In Filmora"></a>Step 2: mport Your Video In Filmora</h4><p>You need to sync the device that you used to film the video with the computer that has Filmora installed. It may be a phone or a camcorder. Once the devices are synced, you should launch the Filmora software and go the <strong>“Media”</strong> button at the top right toolbar. There you will find the <strong>“Import”</strong> button. You will get a pop-up message asking you to choose the type of device. Select the right one, and your video will be imported in the Filmora interface.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Edit-Video-Pace-Time-Lapse-Jump-Cut-Slow-Motion-3"><a href="#Step-3-Edit-Video-Pace-Time-Lapse-Jump-Cut-Slow-Motion-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Edit Video Pace: Time-Lapse, Jump Cut, Slow Motion"></a>Step 3: Edit Video Pace: Time-Lapse, Jump Cut, Slow Motion</h4><p>To create crisp, fast-paced videos, you don’t have to gobble up the content eyeing at the duration. Think smart when you have the resources of a tool like Filmora. Here are the three best features that help you create fast-paced yet well-defined recipes.</p><p><strong>Time-Lapse:</strong> The time-lapse feature allows you to adjust the speed of the video from slow-motion to 10x faster. To use this, double click on a specific clip in your imported video and open the custom speed settings. Use the adjusting meter beside speed to make your clip as fast or slow as you want. You may use the same feature to introduce the slow-motion effects in certain areas of the video.</p><p>Now, when you are using either the fast-forward or slow-motion effects, it is best to have stable video footage with consistent lighting and a static background. There are also the options of Reverse Speed that can play the clip backward, as in flash-back. The Ripple edit feature allows you to cut short a long clip seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Jump Cut:</strong> The Jump Cut is about snipping unwanted areas in the clip. It may sound like the Ripple edit mentioned above, but the ripple edit is more functional for cutting short a continuous video so that the viewer won’t realize the snip. For the Jump Cut, it doesn’t have to be a constant clip. You can get to the next frame or scene with an abracadabra move.</p><p>To use Jump Cut, place the cursor over the starting of the clip that you want to cut, and right-click on it and select <strong>“Split”</strong> (the <strong>“scissors”</strong> feature on the toolbar does the same thing). To make this look neat, preview the portion of the clip once again and delete the cuts between two clips with the same right-click.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora-3"><a href="#Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora"></a>Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora</h4><p>Transitions make your video more interactive and help you segregate the video from frame-to-frame with effects like dissolve, fade, flash, etc. there are numerous transition options available within the Filmora suit.</p><p>The best way to do this drag and drop the clips on the timeline is to trim parts of the clip to shorten it.

VLC is a completely free media player that can play almost any type of file, is great for converting files, and can even be used as a screen recorder. If you consume a lot of media online then chances are you already have VLC. You could also use is Free Video to MP3 Converter by DVDVideoSoft.</p><p>If you choose to use VLC, open it up and select <strong>Convert&#x2F;Save</strong> under <strong>Media</strong>.

Removing Background Noise in Audacity</h4><p>You can download Audacity for free at Audacityteam.org.</p><p>Once you have Audacity use it to open your MP3. Then, find a section of your audio that is silent aside from your background noise and highlight it by clicking and dragging. The idea is to point out to the program exactly what sound is a problem for you so it knows what to remove. If you have trouble finding a significant stretch of background noise that does not also include dialogue remember to record a pause before or after the content of your video next time you film.</p><p>With your section of background noise highlighted, go to <strong>Effect</strong> and then <strong>Noise Reduction</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Get Noise Profile</strong>. After that, you will select your entire audio timeline before going back to <strong>Noise Reduction</strong> under <strong>Effect</strong>. This time click on <strong>OK</strong> (the default settings are the best in most situations so you do not need to worry about changing them).</p><p>Audacity will remove everything that sounds like the sound profile, eliminating your background noise. Sometimes this method will also dull your dialogue, which can be fixed by selecting your entire track and then going to <strong>Effect</strong> and <strong>Amplify</strong>. Increasing amplification will fix any muffling of your audio.</p><h4 id="3-Syncing-in-Filmora"><a href="#3-Syncing-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3. Syncing in Filmora"></a>3. Syncing in Filmora</h4><p>Export your corrected MP3 from Audacity and import it into Filmora. Then, drag it into your music track. Syncing your audio should not be difficult, but you can always use your original audio to help you line it up properly if you need to. Just look for a significant spike in your audio waves in both your MP3 and the original audio and make sure they are right on top of each other.</p><p>Then, since you no longer need your original audio, you can delete it. Right-click on your clip and select <strong>Audio Detach</strong>. Once your audio is on its own track just select it and click delete.</p><h3 id="Covering-Background-Noise"><a href="#Covering-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Covering Background Noise"></a>Covering Background Noise</h3><p>Sometimes background noise is so minor that you do not want to bother going through the process of removing it. In these situations, it may be easier to cover up your background noise than to remove it. This is as simple as dragging a song into the music track of your timeline and adjusting its volume so it is not loud enough to draw attention away from your dialogue.

Fear of Looking Stupid Talking To Your Camera"></a>1. Fear of Looking Stupid Talking To Your Camera</h3><p>It can be nerve-racking to talk to your camera in public, especially if your vlog set-up attracts a lot of attention (Casey Neistat’s famous rig consisting of a DSLR camera with a GorillaPod tripod and a Rode shotgun mic attached to it definitely attracts more attention than just your everyday smartphone). Despite a lot of vloggers suggesting that people don’t care as much as you think they care, it still is an activity that stands out, gets noticed, and creates curiosity, which is plenty to feel nervous about.</p><p>My advice is to start with shorter conversations with your camera in public and gradually build your way up to longer ones or save all your longer talks for when you’re in a more private setting. Short conversations may include one simple sentence about where you are going. Then, in another separate recording, in a different setting with different people, you can explain why you’re going there. If you’ve never broken up your speech like this for your vlogs, you might wonder if this will make your vlogs look disjointed. But this is actually a technique (below) that can enhance your vlogs.</p><p>As you continue to vlog in public more, you’ll become increasingly comfortable with it.</p><h3 id="2-Fear-of-Being-Judged-by-Others"><a href="#2-Fear-of-Being-Judged-by-Others" class="headerlink" title="2. Fear of Being Judged by Others"></a>2. Fear of Being Judged by Others</h3><p>After uploading your vlog online, the next thing you might worry about is being judged and criticized by anonymous haters on the internet. No matter how perfectly you present yourself, this will happen. But you will be ok.</p><p>You just need to be strongly grounded in your intrinsic worth and not take too seriously the judgments of those who don’t even know you. You can adjust your community settings on YouTube so that you have more control over others’ comments. But I suggest you just get used to others’ disapproval because it’s something that comes with putting yourself out there on such a public platform.</p><h3 id="3-Fear-of-Not-Being-Interesting-Enough"><a href="#3-Fear-of-Not-Being-Interesting-Enough" class="headerlink" title="3. Fear of Not Being Interesting Enough"></a>3. Fear of Not Being Interesting Enough</h3><p>A lot of people fear that they aren’t interesting enough to watch. This fear stops many people from vlogging. Some people get around this self-doubt by focusing their content on something other than themselves. But people are so much more interesting than the tools and objects that they test out and review on YouTube. Even if you’re unable to secure the interest of the masses, there are bound to be a handful of people from all around the world who do find you interesting.</p><h3 id="4-Fear-of-Your-Lifestyle-Not-Being-Exciting-Enough"><a href="#4-Fear-of-Your-Lifestyle-Not-Being-Exciting-Enough" class="headerlink" title="4. Fear of Your Lifestyle Not Being Exciting Enough"></a>4. Fear of Your Lifestyle Not Being Exciting Enough</h3><p>When you look at the vlogs of many of the top YouTubers, their lives appear so action-packed. It’s hard not to think that all vlogs are meant to be very stimulating. But if you believe that that is the standard for vlogs, you might either be discouraged and drop vlogging altogether or you might try too hard to schedule your life around getting stimulating vlog content. Neither is a good option. Face your fear of your audience getting bored and just go ahead and vlog your lifestyle just as it is.</p><h3 id="5-Fear-of-Losing-Your-Authenticity"><a href="#5-Fear-of-Losing-Your-Authenticity" class="headerlink" title="5. Fear of Losing Your Authenticity"></a>5. Fear of Losing Your Authenticity</h3><p>When you have the ability to control what others see, you may be tempted to present yourself and your life in the most likable way to avoid disapproval and rejection. But the further away from your true self that you fabricate your story, the more inauthentic you’ll feel. Embrace disapproval and rejection and understand that, no matter how perfectly you present yourself, you just can’t avoid disapproval and rejection. It’s going to happen no matter what! So you might as well present yourself just as you are.</p><h3 id="6-Fear-of-Your-Production-Not-Being-Good-Enough"><a href="#6-Fear-of-Your-Production-Not-Being-Good-Enough" class="headerlink" title="6. Fear of Your Production Not Being Good Enough"></a>6. Fear of Your Production Not Being Good Enough</h3><p>Fearing that your production quality won’t measure up is another common fear that holds people back from vlogging. Just get started and put something together with the equipment and skills you already have. Loosen up a bit on your rigid high standards and experience for yourself that the consequences of doing your best with what you have are not so bad. You will develop your equipment and skills as you get more and more into vlogging.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016134/19272" target="_top" id="2016134">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016134" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016134/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Fear-of-Failing-To-Get-Big"><a href="#7-Fear-of-Failing-To-Get-Big" class="headerlink" title="7.

You can then make sure to exclude those from your vlog who are uncomfortable with appearing in your vlog.</p><p>Sometimes, though, as much as you try to exclude certain people from your vlogs, they might still end up in your footage.

In both filming and editing, you can choose to share whatever you’re comfortable with sharing with the rest of the world.</p><p>In post-production, you can use some video editing software to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >delete unwanted parts from the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> clip, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >blur the video background <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or adjust the video color. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is such a video editing software that has been widely used by many YouTubers; you can download it now and have a try.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-2"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-2" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>All forms of creative expression that require you to put yourself out there for the world to see can be scary. But even though other forms of creative expression, like art and writing, may reflect something about the personhood of their creator, very few forms of creative expression seem to shine as much of a spotlight on who you are as a person as vlogging.</p><p>When it comes to vlogging, it is your face, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >voice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thoughts, and feelings that your audience sees and hears close-up.

Fear of Looking Stupid Talking To Your Camera"></a>1. Fear of Looking Stupid Talking To Your Camera</h3><p>It can be nerve-racking to talk to your camera in public, especially if your vlog set-up attracts a lot of attention (Casey Neistat’s famous rig consisting of a DSLR camera with a GorillaPod tripod and a Rode shotgun mic attached to it definitely attracts more attention than just your everyday smartphone). Despite a lot of vloggers suggesting that people don’t care as much as you think they care, it still is an activity that stands out, gets noticed, and creates curiosity, which is plenty to feel nervous about.</p><p>My advice is to start with shorter conversations with your camera in public and gradually build your way up to longer ones or save all your longer talks for when you’re in a more private setting. Short conversations may include one simple sentence about where you are going. Then, in another separate recording, in a different setting with different people, you can explain why you’re going there. If you’ve never broken up your speech like this for your vlogs, you might wonder if this will make your vlogs look disjointed. But this is actually a technique (below) that can enhance your vlogs.</p><p>As you continue to vlog in public more, you’ll become increasingly comfortable with it.</p><h3 id="2-Fear-of-Being-Judged-by-Others-2"><a href="#2-Fear-of-Being-Judged-by-Others-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Fear of Being Judged by Others"></a>2. Fear of Being Judged by Others</h3><p>After uploading your vlog online, the next thing you might worry about is being judged and criticized by anonymous haters on the internet. No matter how perfectly you present yourself, this will happen. But you will be ok.</p><p>You just need to be strongly grounded in your intrinsic worth and not take too seriously the judgments of those who don’t even know you. You can adjust your community settings on YouTube so that you have more control over others’ comments. But I suggest you just get used to others’ disapproval because it’s something that comes with putting yourself out there on such a public platform.</p><h3 id="3-Fear-of-Not-Being-Interesting-Enough-2"><a href="#3-Fear-of-Not-Being-Interesting-Enough-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Fear of Not Being Interesting Enough"></a>3. Fear of Not Being Interesting Enough</h3><p>A lot of people fear that they aren’t interesting enough to watch. This fear stops many people from vlogging. Some people get around this self-doubt by focusing their content on something other than themselves. But people are so much more interesting than the tools and objects that they test out and review on YouTube. Even if you’re unable to secure the interest of the masses, there are bound to be a handful of people from all around the world who do find you interesting.</p><h3 id="4-Fear-of-Your-Lifestyle-Not-Being-Exciting-Enough-2"><a href="#4-Fear-of-Your-Lifestyle-Not-Being-Exciting-Enough-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Fear of Your Lifestyle Not Being Exciting Enough"></a>4. Fear of Your Lifestyle Not Being Exciting Enough</h3><p>When you look at the vlogs of many of the top YouTubers, their lives appear so action-packed. It’s hard not to think that all vlogs are meant to be very stimulating. But if you believe that that is the standard for vlogs, you might either be discouraged and drop vlogging altogether or you might try too hard to schedule your life around getting stimulating vlog content. Neither is a good option. Face your fear of your audience getting bored and just go ahead and vlog your lifestyle just as it is.</p><h3 id="5-Fear-of-Losing-Your-Authenticity-2"><a href="#5-Fear-of-Losing-Your-Authenticity-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Fear of Losing Your Authenticity"></a>5. Fear of Losing Your Authenticity</h3><p>When you have the ability to control what others see, you may be tempted to present yourself and your life in the most likable way to avoid disapproval and rejection. But the further away from your true self that you fabricate your story, the more inauthentic you’ll feel. Embrace disapproval and rejection and understand that, no matter how perfectly you present yourself, you just can’t avoid disapproval and rejection. It’s going to happen no matter what! So you might as well present yourself just as you are.</p><h3 id="6-Fear-of-Your-Production-Not-Being-Good-Enough-2"><a href="#6-Fear-of-Your-Production-Not-Being-Good-Enough-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Fear of Your Production Not Being Good Enough"></a>6. Fear of Your Production Not Being Good Enough</h3><p>Fearing that your production quality won’t measure up is another common fear that holds people back from vlogging. Just get started and put something together with the equipment and skills you already have. Loosen up a bit on your rigid high standards and experience for yourself that the consequences of doing your best with what you have are not so bad. You will develop your equipment and skills as you get more and more into vlogging.</p><h3 id="7-Fear-of-Failing-To-Get-Big-2"><a href="#7-Fear-of-Failing-To-Get-Big-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Fear of Failing To Get Big"></a>7. Fear of Failing To Get Big</h3><p>Getting a lot of subscribers is a common end goal for many who go into vlogging. This goal can seem impossible to reach with how crowded the vlogosphere has become with so many ambitious vloggers who are competing for views and subscribers.</p><p>How can you know for sure that you won’t be wasting your time and effort trying? The truth is… you can’t know for sure. But dismissing all of your time and effort as a waste just because you’re not at the end yet will take away from the joy you could have with vlogging. Rather than focusing on getting big, focus on enjoying the process of vlogging.</p><h3 id="8-Fear-of-Being-Distracted-From-the-Moment-2"><a href="#8-Fear-of-Being-Distracted-From-the-Moment-2" class="headerlink" title="8. Fear of Being Distracted From the Moment"></a>8. Fear of Being Distracted From the Moment</h3><p>Whether you’re vlogging or not, living in the present moment can already be a challenge with a smartphone. When something exhilarating happens, many of us feel compelled to pull out our phone to capture it, only to experience that fleeting moment through a small preview screen.</p><p>Vlogging appears to take that to another level, especially if you’re using complicated equipment that takes more time to set up and if you’re trying to capture enough footage to produce an entire vlog out of one day. How could all that time devoted to capturing your footage not get in the way of your present moment?</p><p>Well, like all hobbies, activities, and passions, vlogging does take time and you’re going to have to accept that it does. You may not know it now, but after giving vlogging a try, you may discover that you really enjoy it. And if you do, you won’t worry about missing out on life just as a painter who happens to be in the middle of his painting during a sunset wouldn’t worry about the sunset he’s missing out on.</p><p>If, in the end, you realize you don’t enjoy vlogging, then at least you’re left with a documented piece of a memory that you can relive again and again, which can actually help you appreciate your past moments even more.</p><h3 id="9-Fear-of-Making-Others-Uncomfortable-2"><a href="#9-Fear-of-Making-Others-Uncomfortable-2" class="headerlink" title="9. Fear of Making Others Uncomfortable"></a>9. Fear of Making Others Uncomfortable</h3><p>Even though you might have learned to enjoy and be comfortable with vlogging, your vlogging might make others uncomfortable. You can still vlog while respecting others’ boundaries by having a conversation first, before you start vlogging, around whether or not they feel comfortable with appearing in your vlog. You can then make sure to exclude those from your vlog who are uncomfortable with appearing in your vlog.</p><p>Sometimes, though, as much as you try to exclude certain people from your vlogs, they might still end up in your footage. You might even find out after you’ve captured great footage that people do not want to be in your video. In these cases, you can always censor their faces out in editing.</p><h3 id="10-Fear-of-Permanently-Leaving-a-Bad-Mark-2"><a href="#10-Fear-of-Permanently-Leaving-a-Bad-Mark-2" class="headerlink" title="10.

Just like a book with an appealing cover compels a person to pick it up and read, it is significant to display and advertise your YouTube channel in a way that makes viewers click and browse through the channel.</p><p>Despite creating a beautiful banner on your desktop screen, it might end up distorted on a mobile screen if the recommended sizes for all kinds of gadgets are not followed.

Are you wondering how to create the perfect banner or cover photo as we know it? Worry not as we are going to tell you the exact details to achieve an ideal YouTube banner size that fits all devices from computers to phones.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: The Recommended YouTube Banner Size</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: The Best YouTube Banner Size on Different Devices</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: The Best YouTube Video Maker–Wondershare Filmora</strong></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1576477/17382" target="_top" id="1576477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1576477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1576477/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-The-Recommended-YouTube-Banner-Size"><a href="#Part-1-The-Recommended-YouTube-Banner-Size" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Recommended YouTube Banner Size"></a>Part 1: The Recommended YouTube Banner Size</h2><p>According to YouTube’s official standards, the recommended banner size is 2560×1440 pixels.

The first 15 seconds of a video is when viewers are most likely to decide to click on one of the recommended videos, or go back to their search results and choose something else. The odds of them leaving within these first 15 seconds are greater if you do not get right to the main point of your video. That is why long intro sequences are bad for your watch time.</p><p>Whether it is better to put your intro at the very beginning of your video, or after you introduce your topic, will depend on your viewers. You may want to try it both ways and then look at your retention report (found in your YouTube Creator Studio under Analytics) to see which works best for you.</p><h4 id="Top-Intro-Sites"><a href="#Top-Intro-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Top Intro Sites"></a>Top Intro Sites</h4><p>There are a few different sites where you can download animated intros, customized to include your username or logo. Here are two of the best:</p><p><strong>FlixPress.com</strong></p><p>This is probably the most popular intro site. There are a lot of great animated intros available for under $5, or even for free.</p><p><strong>IntroMaker.net</strong></p><p>This is another site with really professional looking intros for $5. They only have two free options, though.</p><h4 id="Creating-an-Intro-in-Filmora"><a href="#Creating-an-Intro-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Creating an Intro in Filmora"></a>Creating an Intro in Filmora</h4><p>You can create a simple intro card in <strong>Filmora</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><ol><li>Choose your background. You may want to use a short clip as your intro, or you may just want a colored background.</li><li>Drag your clip or background into the video track of your timeline and trim it down to five seconds.</li><li>If you have a logo, import it into Filmora and drag it into your picture-in-picture track.</li><li>With your logo selected, click on the Green Screen icon. In the pop-up, select the background of your logo to make it transparent. For this to work your logo cannot be the same color as its background.</li><li>Click on the editing icon with your logo selected and choose an animation.</li><li>Go to the Text&#x2F;Titles menu and choose an animated title that suits your channel. Drag it into your text track and edit it to include your name.</li><li>The last piece of your intro is sound. You can choose a song from Filmora’s library and cut it down to five seconds, or import your sound effect.</li><li>Export your video and save it for use in all of your other videos.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-End-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-End-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: End Cards"></a>Part 2: End Cards</h2><p>When your video ends, YouTube will recommend a selection of videos users may want to watch next. Often, these recommendations will not include more of your videos.</p><p>To keep viewers on your channel, you can create your End Card which recommends other content you have created.</p><h4 id="Elements-of-an-End-Card"><a href="#Elements-of-an-End-Card" class="headerlink" title="Elements of an End Card"></a>Elements of an End Card</h4><p>An end card includes clips from two or three of your videos, muted, and shrunk down to thumbnail-size. Using spotlight annotations you can make these thumbnails click-able.</p><p>It is also important that your end card includes multiple calls to action. A call to action is meant to spur a viewer to some kind of action. Writing ‘Check out this video’ above one of your thumbnails is a call to action.</p><p>You should also have a subscribe link somewhere in your end card, ideally a very noticeable button with a proven call to action like ‘Subscribe Now!’.</p><p>Some creators will leave their end cards at that and play music overtop, but it can be even more effective to include a voiceover where you ask viewers to subscribe and watch your other videos.</p><h4 id="How-To-Make-an-End-Card"><a href="#How-To-Make-an-End-Card" class="headerlink" title="How To Make an End Card"></a>How To Make an End Card</h4><ol><li>Choose a static background. You may want to download an end card template or create one in a drawing program. If you do, make sure to include calls to action like ‘Watch more!’ and ‘Subscribe’.</li><li>Drag your background into your timeline at the end of your video.</li><li>Import two or three of your previous videos and drag them into your picture in picture tracks.

It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.</p><p>Even something as small as your <strong>YouTube video thumbnail background</strong> can strongly impact your results.</p><p>Obviously, choosing the right <strong>custom YouTube background</strong> is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.</p><h2 id="Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective"><a href="#Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?"></a>Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?</h2><p>There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.</p><p>The main reasons include:</p><ul><li>Creates a meaningful connection;</li><li>Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;</li><li>Builds a better brand;</li><li>Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.</li></ul><p>So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal <strong>YouTube video background download</strong>.</p><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos"></a>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.</p><h3 id="Content-Relevance"><a href="#Content-Relevance" class="headerlink" title="Content Relevance"></a>Content Relevance</h3><p>As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="Audience-Appeal"><a href="#Audience-Appeal" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.</p><h3 id="Lighting-and-Visibility"><a href="#Lighting-and-Visibility" class="headerlink" title="Lighting and Visibility"></a>Lighting and Visibility</h3><p>Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><h3 id="Personal-Branding"><a href="#Personal-Branding" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.</p><h3 id="Editing"><a href="#Editing" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p>If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a <strong>green screen background for YouTube videos</strong>.</p><h2 id="5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas"><a href="#5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas"></a><strong>5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas</strong></h2><p>It’s finally time to have a look at some examples of highly effective and engaging YouTube video backgrounds for the winter season.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><ul><li>Snowy Landscape</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-1.png"                      alt="snowy landscape youtube background"                ></p><ul><li>Festive Holiday Decor</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-2.png"                      alt="festive holiday decor image"                ></p><ul><li>Cozy Indoor Settings</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-3.png"                      alt="cozy indoor winter background"                ></p><ul><li>Winter Cityscapes</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-4.png"                      alt="winter cityscapes background"                ></p><ul><li>Animated Winter Scenes</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-5.png"                      alt="animated winter scenes background"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094479/7443" target="_top" id="2094479">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094479" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094479/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Create-or-Source-Winter-Backgrounds"><a href="#How-to-Create-or-Source-Winter-Backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="How to Create or Source Winter Backgrounds"></a>How to Create or Source Winter Backgrounds</h2><p>If you want to make your own winter backgrounds or simply edit the ones you have, the most effective way is to use a beginner-friendly video editing platform, such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>This type of platform has all the necessary tools, templates, and presets for professionals to use but all of it is packed in a very easy-to-use interface that anyone can get the hang of.</p><p>Just follow these steps and you’ll have the perfect winter <strong>background for YouTube</strong> in no time.</p><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Download and install the Filmora video editing tool.</p><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Run the program and click on <strong>“</strong>New Project”.

Instead of having your main light off to one side set it up directly in front of you so your entire face is lit evenly. It is still a good idea to use fill lights in this set up to give you some dimension, and a backlight is even more essential for helping you stand out from the background.

By creating a great lighting set up you can ensure that the people watching your videos are only thinking about how much they’re enjoying them.</p><p>Going outside and using natural light is the cheapest way to get a lot of light for your videos.

A window will work, but if you do not have access to one where you are filming then consider an LED panel light or a softbox light like the ones used in portrait photography.</p><p>This first light will create a dramatic shadow across half of your face.

This reflector is called your <strong>‘Fill Light’</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>fill light</strong> is less bright than the primary source of light and it is placed on the side opposite to the key light. Its purpose is to reduce shadows produced by the key light and the reflector will need to be mounted on a stand.</p><p>The final step to creating three point lighting is to set up another light behind you. This is your ‘Backlight’, and it will help you stand out from your background. <strong>Backlight or Hair light</strong> is always placed behind and above the subject to create separation between the subject in the shot and the background.

Some even go so far to compare <strong>IGTV to YouTube</strong>, currently, the largest video sharing platform in the world that hosts 300 minutes of video each minute. IGTV may have fewer users than YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find a way to use it effectively for a wide array of different purposes. So, in this article, we are going to take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of each platform in order to help you discover how you can utilize each of these social networks to broaden the audience for the content you share online.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Reels VS Instagram Stories–Everything You Need to Know &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: Which One Is Better? &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="IGTV-VS-YouTube-What’s-the-difference"><a href="#IGTV-VS-YouTube-What’s-the-difference" class="headerlink" title="IGTV VS YouTube: What’s the difference"></a>IGTV VS YouTube: What’s the difference</h2><p>Comparison between IGTV and YouTube is somewhat unfair towards the former since IGTV is a much younger platform that still needs time to develop. YouTube, on the other hand, has a reputation as one of the most reliable video sharing platforms ever created that enables people from all walks of life to upload and share music, movies, gaming videos and virtually any other type of moving images. Even so, let’s take a look at major differences and similarities between IGTV and YouTube.</p><h4 id="Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences"><a href="#Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Have a Quick Glance of the Differences"></a>Have a Quick Glance of the Differences</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Interface Differences</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">The Upload Process</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Discovering New Content</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part4">Monetization</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part5">Analytics and Insights</a></p><h4 id="1-Interface-Differences"><a href="#1-Interface-Differences" class="headerlink" title="1. Interface Differences"></a>1. Interface Differences</h4><p>Despite the fact that you can access IGTV from a web browser, this platform is predominantly dedicated to videos that are going to be watched on mobile devices. This also means that the thumbnails of the videos you uploaded to your IGTV channel are going to be displayed differently than those on your YouTube channel. The interfaces of these two social networks are entirely different, but if you are a newcomer to each of these platforms you won’t have much trouble getting used to them.</p><h4 id="2-The-Upload-Process"><a href="#2-The-Upload-Process" class="headerlink" title="2. The Upload Process"></a>2. The Upload Process</h4><p>The fact that you can only upload vertically oriented videos to IGTV somewhat limits your options because you either have to record a video for IGTV specifically or you must edit a horizontally oriented video and change its aspect ratio to 9:16. You can upload videos to YouTube and IGTV directly from your computer or you can use iPhone and Android-based apps to capture videos with your phone and upload them to either of these platforms. The maximum duration of an IGTV video can’t exceed sixty minutes, while the default duration of all videos on YouTube is set to 15 minutes. Nonetheless, if you own a verified YouTube account, you can upload videos that have 128GB and last up to 12 hours.</p><p>At the moment the videos you want to upload to your IGTV channel have to be saved in the MP4 file format because the platform still doesn’t offer support for any other video file format. YouTube grants much more freedom in this respect as it allows you to upload videos saved in AVI, FLV, MOV, MP4 and other commonly used file formats.</p><h4 id="3-Discovering-New-Content"><a href="#3-Discovering-New-Content" class="headerlink" title="3. Discovering New Content"></a>3. Discovering New Content</h4><p>IGTV is more than a decade younger than YouTube, so you shouldn’t be surprised if you’re having trouble discovering new content. Moreover, IGTV’s search engine is still relatively new and it is much less powerful than the one used by YouTube. This is the reason why the videos you upload to your YouTube channel are going to be much easier to find via a simple Google search than those you shared on IGTV. Besides, YouTube offers much more new content on a daily basis than IGTV, and it is clear that the Instagram’s new brainchild still has ways to go before it reaches the point when it can challenge the largest video sharing platform in the world in terms of diversity of the content that it delivers to its users.</p><h4 id="4-Monetization"><a href="#4-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="4. Monetization"></a>4. Monetization</h4><p>At the moment, views and likes can’t be monetized on IGTV, so most influencers rely on sponsorships from brands. Things may change as the platform grows, but for the time being IGTV doesn’t provide the content creators with any compensation for the work they are putting in. YouTube allows content creators to monetize their videos through Google Adsense for years, and some of its most prominent users like PewDiePie or Logan Paul have earned hundreds of millions of dollars by posting new content on their YouTube channels. Keep in mind that you are going to need at least a thousand subscribers and 4,000 hours of viewing time before you can enable YouTube’s Monetize feature.</p><h4 id="5-Analytics-and-Insights"><a href="#5-Analytics-and-Insights" class="headerlink" title="5. Analytics and Insights"></a>5. Analytics and Insights</h4><p>Knowing how many people watched the entire video or how many likes and comments certain types of videos get can help you produce content that attracts a larger audience on all social networks. The metrics such as engagement or view-through rates can be essential during online marketing campaigns as they can suggest how many people are watching your videos and for how long. The analytics tools YouTube provides are much more diverse than those offered by IGTV that only lets you see the audience retention graph and the number of views and comments a video currently has. YouTube is an obviously a much better option for anyone who wants to conduct an in-depth analysis of their content’s performance, although the tools on IGTV are still powerful enough to indicate which type of content your audience likes the most.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123748/7443" target="_top" id="2123748">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123748" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123748/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Shouldn’t-You-Use-YouTube-and-IGTV-For-the-Same-Purposes"><a href="#Why-Shouldn’t-You-Use-YouTube-and-IGTV-For-the-Same-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?"></a>Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?</h2><p>You shouldn’t assume that you can post the same type of videos on your YouTube and IGTV channels, just because they are both video sharing platforms. The content you create for your IGTV channel needs to be dynamic and entertaining in order to captivate the audience’s attention. Posting tutorials or hour-long gaming videos on IGTV won’t attract as many viewers as on YouTube, which is why businesses who want to use IGTV to promote their products and services need to choose the content carefully. Furthermore, the videos that last between two and five minutes are still by far the most popular on IGTV, so even though technically you can upload a video that lasts one hour to your IGTV channel, the chances are that such long videos won’t get a lot of views.</p><p>IGTV is probably best used as a tool that can help improve the engagement with your followers on Instagram, but if you want to become an established video content creator, then running a YouTube channel is simply a much better option. It still remains to be seen how will IGTV evolve in the years to come, but at the present moment this platform doesn’t really have any chance of challenging YouTube’s position as the world’s leading video sharing platform.</p><p>However, no matter which video platform you choose, you need to ensure the videos you create are of high quality. A good video editing software like Filmora can help you acheive this goal.</p><p><strong>Useful Features of Filmora</strong></p><ul><li>Cokor Matching: Apply color correction setting to multiple clips

How Much Do YouTubers Make Per View?"></a><strong>Part 1. How Much Do YouTubers Make Per View?</strong></h2><p>Are you curious about how much YouTubers make per view? Most people are. The Influencer Marketing Hub estimates that the average YouTuber makes $0.018 per view. These rates vary from $0.10 to $0.30 per ad view depending on the type of video and location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-cpm-rates-how-much-do-youtubers-make-1.JPG"                      alt="factors affecting youtube cpm"                ></p><p>The YouTube monetization rates vary significantly because of various factors:</p><ul><li>The number of views a video receives</li><li>The number of clicks an ad receives</li><li>Ad blockers</li><li>Ad Quality</li><li>Video length</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Do-YouTubers-Make-Per-1-000-Views"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Do-YouTubers-Make-Per-1-000-Views" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Quality content attracts a large audience, enabling a way to generate ad revenue. Although it may be difficult to grow a YouTube channel, the revenue generated is worth. The youtube monetization rates determine the amount you can earn for every 1,000 views on your videos.</p><p>Allowing advertiser to run their ads on your channel through Google AdSense is an effective way of monetizing YouTube Content. The advertisers pay YouTube to display their products on the platform. YouTube then pays YouTubers for displaying the ads on their videos. Although the YouTube monetization rates may vary, overall revenue generated is usually substantial.</p><p>Each view will generate $0.10 to $0.30 or an average of $0.018. The YouTuber will be paid $18 on average for a video with 1,000 ad views. The amount paid depends on the CPM (Cost per Mille), which is the cost of advertising to 1,000 people. Brands will incur between $4 and $24 on YouTube to advertise on YouTube. However, the revenue generated by the Youtuber will be lower because not all the 1,000 views will be ad views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-cpm-rates-how-much-do-youtubers-make-2.JPG"                      alt="average youtube earnings"                ></p><p>Most YouTubers report to earn around $5 to $7 from 1,000 views of their videos.

You could argue that Samsung has impressive sales and is almost at par with Apple but in regards to sheer dominance or superiority, the South Korea based conglomerate bows down to the American tech juggernaut. YouTube is indisputably the most popular video hosting and sharing site in the world. It doesn’t help that YouTube is owned by Google, the search engine giant that also owns Android which powers all popular Samsung smartphones at the moment. As a result, what you get is a tad incompatible with YouTube and iPhone or iPad. Downloading YouTube videos is very simple if you are using an Android smartphone or a Windows computer.

Most of these free video downloader apps will save your videos within the app. Some would add them to the videos in your Camera Roll. You can use AirPlay to watch the videos if you have an Apple TV.

But if you don’t keep on top of it, your Watch Later list can quickly become unmanageable and cluttered with content that you no longer want to watch afterward.</p><p>If you are wondering how, you can declutter the playlist, we’ve got you covered. To help you with the task, we’ve compiled a comprehensive step-by-step guide. In this article, we will show you how to clear Watch Later on YouTube with just a few clicks.</p><p>So, without beating around the bush, let’s get started with our tutorial!</p><h2 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist</h2><p>If your YouTube Watch Later playlist is filled with videos you’ll never watch again, or you are not interested in that specific content type, you can quickly delete these videos at any time.</p><p>Here’s the step-by-step process on <strong>how to clear Watch Later on YouTube Web and App:</strong></p><h3 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-Web"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-Web" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On Web?"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On Web?</h3><p>You can delete the YouTube Watch Later Playlist on your desktop in the following ways:</p><h5 id="From-YouTube-Homepage"><a href="#From-YouTube-Homepage" class="headerlink" title="From YouTube Homepage"></a>From YouTube Homepage</h5><p>To clear the YouTube Watch Later Playlist from the YouTube Homepage, do the following steps:</p><p>Step1 First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/index?feature=signin"><strong>YouTube homepage</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Sign into your account if needed and click the <strong>“Library”</strong> option located at the left-hand side menu panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-youtube-web-library.png"                      alt="accessing the youtube web library"                ></p><p>Step2 Croll down and click the <strong>“See All”</strong> option under the Watch Later header. Click the <strong>Three Dots</strong> below the Watch Later playlist details on the next page.</p><p>Step3 From the drop-down menu, click <strong>“Remove Watch Videos.”</strong> This will instantly remove all the videos you’ve watched but are still in the playlist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/removing-watched-videos-from-youtube-watch-later.png"                      alt="removing watched videos from youtube watch later"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, to remove the unwatched videos, hover over a video and click the <strong>Three Dots</strong>. Select the <strong>“Remove from Watch Later”</strong> option to delete the video. You can repeat this process to remove all the content from the playlist until it is decluttered at the point of your satisfaction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clearing-the-youtube-watch-later-playlist.png"                      alt="clearing the youtube watch later playlist"                ></p><h5 id="Using-A-Script"><a href="#Using-A-Script" class="headerlink" title="Using A Script"></a>Using A Script</h5><p>Since the above process can be tiring, you can use a script to remove all the videos at once from the Watch Later playlist in the following way:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en%5Fpk/chrome/"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a> browser on your system and head to the <strong>YouTube</strong> website**.** Next, select the <strong>“Library”</strong> option in the left pane and click <strong>“Watch Later”</strong> from the menu.</p><p>Step2 Now, hit the <strong>“Ctrl + Shift + J”</strong> keys on Windows or the <strong>“Command + Option+ J”</strong> buttons on Mac to launch the developer mode and open the console window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-script-to-clear-watch-later.png"                      alt="using script to clear watch later"                ></p><p>Step3 Copy and paste the following lines of the script at the end of the line under the Console tab where the cursor is blinking.</p><p>setInterval(function () { document.querySelector(‘#primary button[aria-label&#x3D;”Action menu”]‘).click(); var things &#x3D; document.evaluate(‘&#x2F;&#x2F;span[contains(text(),”Remove from”)]‘, document, null, XPathResult.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE, null ); for (var i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; things.snapshotLength; i++) { things.snapshotItem(i).click(); } }, 1000);</p><p>Step4 In the last step, hit the <strong>“Enter”</strong> key to clear the Watch Later Playlist on YouTube. However, the process may take some time, depending on the number of videos in your playlist.</p><p>Although a bit tech-savvy, the script execution method is the most effective way to delete all Watch Later videos at once.</p><p>You can also replace the number at the end of the script with a lower entry to delete videos according to your preference. Also, choosing a lesser number can speed up the video deletion process from YouTube Watch Later list by a great deal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to note that experimenting with scripts is only for some. The script above has been confirmed to work, but others still need to be thoroughly checked and could potentially damage your computer. To prevent this from happening, only look for scripts from reliable sources instead of those posted by random people in various forums.</p><h3 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-YouTube-App"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-YouTube-App" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On YouTube App?"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On YouTube App?</h3><p>If you are using YouTube on an Android or iOS device, it is possible to clear the Watch Later Playlist by doing the steps below:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, <strong>swipe up</strong> on the Homescreen of your Android device or <strong>swipe right</strong> on your iOS device to launch App Drawer, and tap “<strong>YouTube”</strong> to launch the app.</p><p>Step2 Now, tap the <strong>“Library”</strong> option in the bottom-right corner of the screen and tap <strong>“Watch Later.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-watch-later-playlist.png"                      alt="accessing the watch later playlist"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, tap the three dots (vertical ellipses) icon on the top-right side of the screen and choose the <strong>“Remove Watched Videos”</strong> option to delete them from the playlist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clearing-watch-later-on-youtube-app.png"                      alt="clearing watch later on youtube app"                ></p><p>Step4 If there are still unwatched videos in the playlist, select a video and tap the three dots next to it.

Smartphones have really great cameras, and you probably always have your phone with you. You can even post directly from your phone to YouTube!</p><h2 id="How-To-Make-YouTube-Videos-on-Your-Smartphone-1"><a href="#How-To-Make-YouTube-Videos-on-Your-Smartphone-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Make YouTube Videos on Your Smartphone"></a>How To Make YouTube Videos on Your Smartphone</h2><p> Making a video on your smartphone is similar to making a video with any other camera in a lot of ways. There are also a lot of ways in which it is different. You always have to watch out for camera shake, for example, but it can be even harder to control when you’re walking around shooting on your mobile device. Here are three things to keep in mind when vlogging with your smartphone.</p><h4 id="Part-1-Keep-It-Steady"><a href="#Part-1-Keep-It-Steady" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Keep It Steady"></a>Part 1. Keep It Steady</h4><p> For a nice, smooth, shot consider resting your hand up on a railing, table, or anything else that will keep it steady while you film. Camera shake is always distracting to viewers, and smartphone videos are notoriously unstable because you are almost always holding your phone in your hand.</p><p> There is equipment you can use to cut out camera shake. You can get a smartphone mount for your tripod, or you can even stabilize your phone using a selfie stick. Many of the very newest smartphones have built in hardware called ‘OIS’ – optical image stabilization – that helps reduce shakiness.</p><h4 id="Part-2-Be-Heard"><a href="#Part-2-Be-Heard" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Be Heard"></a>Part 2. Be Heard</h4><p> You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you say it! Smartphones do not tend to have very good microphones built in (neither do most cameras), so try to vlog from somewhere without a lot of background noise. It will help a lot if your voice has nothing to compete with.</p><p> Ideally, you should get an external mic to record your voice while you vlog on your phone. There are shotgun mics you can plug directly into the audio jack on your phone which will record great audio, or you can get a high quality MP3 recorder and carry it around in your pocket.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone"><a href="#Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Tilt Your Phone"></a>Part 3. Tilt Your Phone</h4><p> When recording on the spur of the moment with your smartphone it is easy to automatically hold it the same way you would while texting or taking a selfie. If you record a video with your phone held so that it is tall – a ‘portrait’ shot – then your video will have thick black bars on either side when you post it to YouTube. If you tilt your phone so that it is wide you will record a ‘landscape’ shot, which will match the dimensions YouTube plays videos in.</p><p> The exception to this is videos you plan to post on Instagram. On Instagram everything is cropped into a square, and it is easier to imagine what your footage will look like as a square when you hold your phone strait up. Simply focus on the top of your screen and treat a portion of the bottom of your screen as if it is not there. When you hold your phone horizontally you need to try and estimate how much of the middle of your screen will make it in to your Instagram video, which can be awkward.</p><p> Those are the three main things to keep in mind, but if you are planning on posting directly to YouTube from your phone then you should also make sure you have a mobile app you can use to edit it first.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a full-feature video editing app available for both Android and iPhone operating systems.

One-touch themes are sets of related features, like filters and animated titles, which you can apply to your videos all at once. Filmora’s simple interface also makes it easy to apply filters, titles, overlays, transitions, and even royalty free music to your project one at a time.</p><p> After you’ve edited your video in Filmora you can post it directly to YouTube or other social media sites right from the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> It is fun to be able to record a vlog entry whenever inspiration strikes you, and your smartphone is a great choice for recording on the go.

There are also a lot of ways in which it is different. You always have to watch out for camera shake, for example, but it can be even harder to control when you’re walking around shooting on your mobile device. Here are three things to keep in mind when vlogging with your smartphone.</p><h4 id="Part-1-Keep-It-Steady-2"><a href="#Part-1-Keep-It-Steady-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Keep It Steady"></a>Part 1. Keep It Steady</h4><p> For a nice, smooth, shot consider resting your hand up on a railing, table, or anything else that will keep it steady while you film. Camera shake is always distracting to viewers, and smartphone videos are notoriously unstable because you are almost always holding your phone in your hand.</p><p> There is equipment you can use to cut out camera shake. You can get a smartphone mount for your tripod, or you can even stabilize your phone using a selfie stick. Many of the very newest smartphones have built in hardware called ‘OIS’ – optical image stabilization – that helps reduce shakiness.</p><h4 id="Part-2-Be-Heard-2"><a href="#Part-2-Be-Heard-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It will help a lot if your voice has nothing to compete with.</p><p> Ideally, you should get an external mic to record your voice while you vlog on your phone. There are shotgun mics you can plug directly into the audio jack on your phone which will record great audio, or you can get a high quality MP3 recorder and carry it around in your pocket.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone-2"><a href="#Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

This is the majority of YouTube videos, and just about every one you’ve ever watched will have been public. You’ll want this if you want lots of people to watch your video.</p><p> <strong>Unlisted</strong></p><p> Unlisted videos are ones that anybody can view so long as they have the link. The video won’t show up on search results or in “related” or “suggested” videos.</p><p> This is a great setting for sharing a video amongst small groups. You might have a rough edit you want to show a few people, or you might have a show reel that you only want certain people to see.</p><p> <strong>Private</strong></p><p> Completely private videos cannot be watched by anyone who doesn’t have permission. You grant people permission by allowing their Google accounts to access the video. Nobody else can see the video, regardless of whether they have the link.</p><p> It won’t show up on searches, as related or suggested videos, or even when imbedded in other sites. This is the best setting for a video you need to share with only very specific people, if anyone. Below is a comparison table to know more about <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop&hl=en&oco=1" >privacy settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-privacy-setting.JPG"                      alt="youtube privacy setting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Privacy-Settings"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Privacy-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Privacy Settings"></a>Part 2: How to Change Privacy Settings</h2><p> There are two ways to change the privacy settings: firstly, when you upload the video, and secondly through Creator Studio.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p><p> When you upload a video to YouTube you’ll see on the right hand side an option that says “privacy”. This is defaulted to “public”, but you can use the drop-down menu on the button to change the setting. This will apply your privacy setting the second the video finishes uploading and processing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-youtube-video-privacy.jpg"                      alt="upload youtube video privacy"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p><p> To change the privacy setting later, go to Creator Studio, then Video Manager. On the right-hand side you’ll see one of three icons: a world, a chain, and a lock. The world means <strong>“public”</strong>, the chain means <strong>“unlisted”</strong>, and the lock is for <strong>“private”</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlisted-video.JPG"                      alt="youtube privacy settings"                ></p><p> To change the privacy, click the icon. You’ll be taken to the video’s info and settings page. Down below where you see the thumbnails you’ll see the selected privacy setting. Click this to open a drop down menu, and select your desired privacy level.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151854/7443" target="_top" id="2151854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151854/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Sharing-Private-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Sharing-Private-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Sharing Private Videos"></a>Part 3: Sharing Private Videos</h2><p> If a video is set to “private’, you’ll have the option to share it with specific people. Below where it says “private” on the info and settings page you’ll see a button labeled “share”. Click this and type in the email addresses of the people you want to be able to watch the video. You’ll also have the option of notifying the people via email that you’ve shared the video with them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-private-video.JPG"                      alt="share youtube privacy video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080312/19272" target="_top" id="2080312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080312/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> And that’s all there is to it!

This online platform lets you create and demonstrate your ideas. It will capture your viewers’ attention from the very beginning. It also doesn’t matter whatever learning style you engage. Adding YouTube videos to Google Slide will appeal to all levels of individuals.</p><p>More so, it is the best way to provide a break for both the audience and the creator. You can break Google Slide presentations with videos to offer some break. Viewers and the presenter get a breather in the process. The presenter can take a short break from speaking while the video plays. Let’s now dive into <strong>how to embed a YouTube video in Google Slides</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-1.png"                      alt="add youtube video to google slides"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Why should we add a video to Google Slides?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to add a YouTube video to Google Slide</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to choose the right video for your Slides?</a></p><h2 id="Why-should-we-add-a-video-to-Google-Slides"><a href="#Why-should-we-add-a-video-to-Google-Slides" class="headerlink" title="Why should we add a video to Google Slides?"></a>Why should we add a video to Google Slides?</h2><p>There is a great impact of adding video to Google Slides.</p><h4 id="For-attention"><a href="#For-attention" class="headerlink" title="For attention"></a>For attention</h4><p>Videos will automatically awaken you, especially if your thoughts have started to sway during a presentation.

Embed YouTube video to Google Slide by search and selection"></a>Method 1. Embed YouTube video to Google Slide by search and selection</h4><p>Google has owned YouTube since the year 2006. You can, therefore, integrate Google’s products with YouTube easily.</p><p>Step 1. First, go to the slide where you want to embed your video.</p><p>Step 2. Then choose the “Insert” option from the menu bar and hit the “Video” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-2.png"                      alt="how to add youtube video to google slides"                ></p><p>Step 3. It would be best if you now viewed the “YouTube” search bar to type in the video you want to embed. You can use keywords to search for the video in question and view instant search results.</p><p>Step 4. Then select the video you want to embed, and you’ll see it appear on the “Slide.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-3.png"                      alt="how to add youtube video to google slides by search and selection"                ></p><p>Step 5. Format your video. Remember that the entire video will be embedded. You don’t necessarily need the whole video. It is time to select just a brief but relevant clip from the video to use. Then position your video to the right point using the axes from the exact starting point to the finished part you want the video to appear in.</p><h4 id="Method-2-Embed-YouTube-video-to-Google-Slide-by-direct-link"><a href="#Method-2-Embed-YouTube-video-to-Google-Slide-by-direct-link" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Embed YouTube video to Google Slide by direct link"></a>Method 2. Embed YouTube video to Google Slide by direct link</h4><p>You can engage this method if you want to include the entire video.</p><p>Step 1. Get the URL of the specific YouTube video that you want to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-4.png"                      alt="how to add youtube video to google slides by direct link"                ></p><p>Step 2. Then go to your browser’s “Address bar” to copy the YouTube link.</p><p>Step 3. Next, open the “Presentation” slide to put your video to.</p><p>Step 4.

He started his channel on December 9, 2006. Jesse never guessed that he would make enough money to live off of the videos he was creating. Here are some of the ways that he monetized his channel:</p><h4 id="AdSense"><a href="#AdSense" class="headerlink" title="AdSense"></a>AdSense</h4><p>Monetization of videos through AdSense is one of the easiest ways that you can start to profit off your videos. Registering for a <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/#?modal%5Factive=none" >Google AdSense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can earn you between $0.30 and $2.00 per thousand ad impressions (an impression is a click, not a view). How much you make per ad impression depends on a lot of things, including the time of year. There are good months for advertising revenue and bad months. December is usually the hottest month for making money through AdSense because of the holiday shopping season. Some of the other months where you can see huge profits include September for back-to-school, June, and March.</p><p>More popular channels get higher paying ads, and it is harder to earn ad revenue in popular vlogging genres (i.e. gaming) than in more obscure niches.</p><h4 id="Target-the-Right-Demographic"><a href="#Target-the-Right-Demographic" class="headerlink" title="Target the Right Demographic"></a>Target the Right Demographic</h4><p>Some of the largest YouTuber success stories are creators who primarily target younger audiences. Others target men or women specifically.

Be careful: a multichannel network will always want you to sign a contract, and they will take over your AdSense account.</p><h4 id="Social-Blade"><a href="#Social-Blade" class="headerlink" title="Social Blade"></a>Social Blade</h4><p>This site will provide details about your subscription count, which of your videos has the best watch time, and more. It will give you a good impression of what you should be including in your videos and how you can make more money from your channel.</p><h4 id="Uploading-Your-Videos-at-the-Right-Time"><a href="#Uploading-Your-Videos-at-the-Right-Time" class="headerlink" title="Uploading Your Videos at the Right Time"></a>Uploading Your Videos at the Right Time</h4><p>Uploading videos at the right time will make sure that you are on the front page of recently uploaded videos when people are let out of school or taking a break from work. This will earn you lots of views. Set an upload time for all of your videos each day and stick to that schedule.</p><h4 id="Check-out-Webinars"><a href="#Check-out-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Check out Webinars"></a>Check out Webinars</h4><p>Looking into webinars and videos of what other popular YouTube experts have done will help you model their success.</p><h4 id="Collaborate-with-Other-YouTubers"><a href="#Collaborate-with-Other-YouTubers" class="headerlink" title="Collaborate with Other YouTubers"></a>Collaborate with Other YouTubers</h4><p>When you create a collab video you and your partner are each introduced to each other’s subscribers.</p><h4 id="Keep-Quality-Up"><a href="#Keep-Quality-Up" class="headerlink" title="Keep Quality Up"></a>Keep Quality Up</h4><p>Putting time and effort into every upload will ensure that you won’t lose subscribers or viewers because you got a bit lazy.</p><h4 id="Do-Follow-Up-Videos"><a href="#Do-Follow-Up-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Do Follow-Up Videos"></a>Do Follow-Up Videos</h4><p>If you have a particular video that has a lot of views, you may want to consider creating follow-up videos.

On the site, users were anticipated to be allowed to upload, distribute, and watch content without restriction. It has subsequently grown to become one of the world’s most popular video distribution platforms.</p><p>YouTube has evolved into a formidable platform for posting high-quality films with a range of settings and aspects over the years. It has also established a set of authoritarian rules and procedures for dealing with copyright issues as well as dangerous, offensive, and deceptive content. Do you make YouTube videos but are frustrated by the fact that you can only upload fifteen-minute recordings? All you need is quick account verification. This post will show you how to go about doing so.</p><p>Before you decide to submit a video, double-check that it doesn’t infringe on anyone’s copyright and that it follows YouTube’s community guidelines. Let’s have a look at what you need to do to upload longer videos on YouTube and ensure that it gets a lot of views before getting into the main guidelines and requirements.</p><h2 id="Is-There-A-Limit-On-How-Long-A-Video-Can-Be-On-Youtube"><a href="#Is-There-A-Limit-On-How-Long-A-Video-Can-Be-On-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?"></a>Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?</h2><p>Yes, there is a restriction to the duration of videos that can be uploaded to YouTube. YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction.</p><p>Moreover, the length of a YouTube video is determined by whether or not your account is verified. Your YouTube videos can only be 15 minutes long or fewer if you aren’t verified. Your YouTube videos can be up to 12 hours long or 128 GB in size if you are verified.</p><ul><li>Shorter videos were deemed to be superior… You’ll lose viewers if you make a video longer solely for the sake of making it longer. On the other hand, longer videos should be planned into your video material. Videos that are between 7 and 15 minutes long do well in general.</li><li>Surprisingly, people prefer lengthier videos, and artists haven’t noticed a drop in views when they develop longer ones. When they focus on longer films, they’ve seen an increase in views and subscribers. Nikki Tutorials’ videos, for example, were roughly eight minutes long in 2015.</li><li>It’s time to get serious about making lengthier videos. If you want to appear in YouTube’s search, you’ll need to increase the length of your videos steadily. This includes producing other vlogs, in-depth tutorials, and GRWM videos. All of these video formats tend to be lengthy.</li><li>As your videos get longer, you may see that organic views increase as you appear more frequently in organic searches. Because YouTube defines long-video channels as ‘top producers,’ such videos are pushed to the top of search results, you’ll see an increase in subscribers.</li><li>Lastly, A YouTube video should be at least ten minutes long. Videos that are seven to fifteen minutes long tend to do well on the site. Keep in mind, though, that your video should only be as long as it needs to be.</li></ul><h2 id="How-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-To-Youtube-In-A-Step-by-step-Process"><a href="#How-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-To-Youtube-In-A-Step-by-step-Process" class="headerlink" title="How To Upload Longer Videos To Youtube In A Step-by-step Process?"></a>How To Upload Longer Videos To Youtube In A Step-by-step Process?</h2><p>YouTube allows users to submit videos up to 15 minutes in length by default.

YouTube is home to a diverse range of content providers, including gamers, vloggers, marketers, musicians, comedians, life coaches, technology enthusiasts, and many others, with over two billion monthly users. It’s the perfect place to share your films with a wide audience and grow a significant and dedicated following. Moreover, YouTube is a video-sharing platform that allows users to watch, like, share, comment on, and submit videos. The video service is available on Computers, workstations, tablet devices, and cell phones.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Youtube’s Primary Goal?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How To Upload Longer Videos To Youtube In A Step-by-step Process?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part4"></a>Tips On How To Make Your Video More Professional And How To Cut The Length Of Your Youtube Videos</p><h2 id="What-Is-Youtube’s-Primary-Goal-3"><a href="#What-Is-Youtube’s-Primary-Goal-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Youtube’s Primary Goal?"></a>What Is Youtube’s Primary Goal?</h2><p>YouTube was developed to allow anyone to upload any video content they wanted. On the site, users were anticipated to be allowed to upload, distribute, and watch content without restriction. It has subsequently grown to become one of the world’s most popular video distribution platforms.</p><p>YouTube has evolved into a formidable platform for posting high-quality films with a range of settings and aspects over the years. It has also established a set of authoritarian rules and procedures for dealing with copyright issues as well as dangerous, offensive, and deceptive content. Do you make YouTube videos but are frustrated by the fact that you can only upload fifteen-minute recordings? All you need is quick account verification. This post will show you how to go about doing so.</p><p>Before you decide to submit a video, double-check that it doesn’t infringe on anyone’s copyright and that it follows YouTube’s community guidelines. Let’s have a look at what you need to do to upload longer videos on YouTube and ensure that it gets a lot of views before getting into the main guidelines and requirements.</p><h2 id="Is-There-A-Limit-On-How-Long-A-Video-Can-Be-On-Youtube-3"><a href="#Is-There-A-Limit-On-How-Long-A-Video-Can-Be-On-Youtube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?"></a>Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?</h2><p>Yes, there is a restriction to the duration of videos that can be uploaded to YouTube. YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction.</p><p>Moreover, the length of a YouTube video is determined by whether or not your account is verified. Your YouTube videos can only be 15 minutes long or fewer if you aren’t verified. Your YouTube videos can be up to 12 hours long or 128 GB in size if you are verified.</p><ul><li>Shorter videos were deemed to be superior… You’ll lose viewers if you make a video longer solely for the sake of making it longer. On the other hand, longer videos should be planned into your video material. Videos that are between 7 and 15 minutes long do well in general.</li><li>Surprisingly, people prefer lengthier videos, and artists haven’t noticed a drop in views when they develop longer ones. When they focus on longer films, they’ve seen an increase in views and subscribers. Nikki Tutorials’ videos, for example, were roughly eight minutes long in 2015.</li><li>It’s time to get serious about making lengthier videos. If you want to appear in YouTube’s search, you’ll need to increase the length of your videos steadily. This includes producing other vlogs, in-depth tutorials, and GRWM videos. All of these video formats tend to be lengthy.</li><li>As your videos get longer, you may see that organic views increase as you appear more frequently in organic searches. Because YouTube defines long-video channels as ‘top producers,’ such videos are pushed to the top of search results, you’ll see an increase in subscribers.</li><li>Lastly, A YouTube video should be at least ten minutes long. Videos that are seven to fifteen minutes long tend to do well on the site. Keep in mind, though, that your video should only be as long as it needs to be.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037318/7443" target="_top" id="2037318">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037318" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037318/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-To-Youtube-In-A-Step-by-step-Process-3"><a href="#How-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-To-Youtube-In-A-Step-by-step-Process-3" class="headerlink" title="How To Upload Longer Videos To Youtube In A Step-by-step Process?"></a>How To Upload Longer Videos To Youtube In A Step-by-step Process?</h2><p>YouTube allows users to submit videos up to 15 minutes in length by default.

Do a Skit"></a>1. Do a Skit</h4><p>YouTube is the perfect medium for short, generally between one and ten minutes long comedy sketches. The majority of the audience on YouTube isn’t patient enough to sit through a half-hour show, no matter how funny it is (at least not until you have a large fan base).</p><p>Your skit can be about literally anything, as long as it’s short and effective. Having your own unique sense of humor is a crucial factor in ensuring the success of the sketches you post online.</p><h4 id="2-Start-a-Funny-Series-3"><a href="#2-Start-a-Funny-Series-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Start a Funny Series"></a>2. Start a Funny Series</h4><p>Try producing a pilot episode of a comedy series for your YouTube channel. Don’t worry about the budget too much because if your ideas are good even a DIY approach will be enough.</p><p>Producing a funny series requires dedication and commitment to that goal, so don’t let yourself be discouraged easily.</p><h4 id="3-Kid-Baby-and-Animal-Videos-3"><a href="#3-Kid-Baby-and-Animal-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos"></a>3. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos</h4><p>Posting cute videos on your YouTube channel will certainly help you get attention online. The Internet loves videos of adorable babies, cats, dogs and other charming animals. Including these types of videos on your channel can be a good way to boost your subscriber count.</p><p>It is important to note that your content must be unique. Re-posting funny animal videos you find online won’t get you far and will make it impossible to monetize your channel.</p><h4 id="4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits-3"><a href="#4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Machinima and Gameplay Skits"></a>4. Machinima and Gameplay Skits</h4><p>The term machinima means creating a cinematic production by re-using material from video games. Gameplay skits and machinima videos are a great way of reaching millions of gaming fans who enjoy good comedy videos.</p><p>The gaming industry is on the rise, and the audience that wants to watch video game-related content is growing every day. However, these types of videos require an in-depth knowledge of the gaming world, and you really have to know the games you draw from in order to make this idea work.</p><h4 id="5-Parody-Video-3"><a href="#5-Parody-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Parody Video"></a>5. Parody Video</h4><p>A well done, poignant parody never fails to make people laugh. Pop culture provides an endless source of TV shows, movies, and songs that can be used for your parody videos. When pop stars release big new music videos, they always get parodied by someone on YouTube within the first few days in order to capitalize on the trend while it’s fresh.</p><p>Parody videos will provide you with an opportunity to showcase your skills and enable you to show the world that you are a talented, relevant comedian.</p><h4 id="6-Bloopers-3"><a href="#6-Bloopers-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Bloopers"></a>6. Bloopers</h4><p>We all make mistakes. Blooper videos enable us to at least laugh at them. Experienced YouTubers know how easy it is to flub a take, but it takes a brave creator to make an entire video from the shots they messed up.</p><h4 id="7-Lip-Sync-Video-3"><a href="#7-Lip-Sync-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Lip-Sync Video"></a>7. Lip-Sync Video</h4><p>Have you ever imagined what it’s like to be a pop star? Lip-sync videos offer the opportunity to step into someone else’s shoes for a moment and have fun with it. Knowing the song you’re lip-syncing and having good timing can help, but you can hardly go wrong producing a video of yourself pouring your soul into a song you’re lip-syncing.</p><p>Lip-syncing to tunes from the most popular stars in the world will enable you to gain traffic from people looking for content related to those songs and artists.</p><p>Need more YouTube video ideas?
