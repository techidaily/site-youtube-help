<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet

Once you get approval for live streaming, you can connect the YouTube channel to your Google Meet account.

Moreover, the individual who is starting the live stream from Google Meet will get connected to his YouTube channel.

Furthermore, you should use the same email address to enter the Google Meet that is connected to your YouTube account. By using the same email address, you can ensure smooth live streaming of Google Meet sessions to your YouTube channel. Also, you can only use laptops or desktops for initiating live streaming. The reason is that the **Google Meet live stream** on YouTube is not currently available on mobile devices.

Step2 Afterward, click "Google Meet" and tap on the "Stream" option. Once done, click on the “Pencil” icon to open the Settings menu. Now enable the options "Let People Steam Their Meetings" and "Let People Use YouTube to Stream Meetings." Once done with the changes, click on the “Save” button.

Step3 Make sure that the Google account attached to your YouTube channel is capable of live streaming. Once done, go to your YouTube channel and tap on the “Create” button. Afterward, hit the “Live” button.

Step4 Now enter your Google Meet session and click on the “Activities” option. From the Activities menu, select "Live Streaming." Now a small menu will open for live-streaming settings. You can create a new event and add an event title. Make sure to choose the privacy options and desired language. Afterward, click on the “Start Streaming” option.

Step5 A small pop-up will appear that will tell you to remind your participants about live streaming. After reminding, click on the "Start" button. You can see the red "Live" button that will indicate to you the ongoing live-streaming session.

## The Importance of YouTube Likes

Increasing the number of likes on Your YouTube channel helps it grow in several ways. These include:

#### \- Improves the Ranking of Your YouTube Channel

The number of views and engagement can affect your ranking on YouTube because YouTube's algorithm recommends popular content to users. The algorithm uses user engagement, the number of likes, comments, and views to recommend your content to other people.

By increasing the number of YouTube views and engagement on your YouTube channel, your content will rank higher.

#### \- Helps Increase the Number of Your Subscribers

After creating your YouTube channel, you'll focus on getting subscribers. But It can take a long period to get subscribers if you're still new to YouTube. However, if you get more views on your YouTube videos, more people will easily find your channel.

![the importance of youtube likes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/buy-youtube-likes-1.png)

#### \- Make Your Videos Go Viral

Getting popular on YouTube takes time: You have to upload high-quality videos regularly and increase engagement on your videos. YouTube likes can help you get popular and make your videos go viral.

#### \- Help You Build Credibility

Viewers like watching YouTube videos with many likes. If your YouTube channel is still new, getting more likes can help you build your credibility. In turn, this will help you to grow your channel.
