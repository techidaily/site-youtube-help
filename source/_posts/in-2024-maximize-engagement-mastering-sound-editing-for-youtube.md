With a wide range of templates to choose from, you can easily find one that fits your needs and style. Best of all, you can create your outro template in minutes without hiring a designer or spending hours learning complex design software.

The software is easy-to-use and does not require any editor to customize and use the templates. The paid version is divided into 2 tiers: Canva Pro **($54.99 per year**) and Canva for team (**$84\. 90/year)**. One disadvantage of the Canva free version is that it is limited resolution options when exporting your file.

##### Flexclip

You can add text, music, elements, overlays, and branding to your templates to make them more stunning and captivating.

The platform offers 3 paid plans starting at **$8.99/month.** The con here is that the free version is only limited to the export quality of 480p, single royalty-free stock use, and 12 projects limit.

##### Placeit

[Placeit](https://placeit.net/?search=news+outros) is an online editor giving you the ability to create and customize your video content in no time. The editor also includes a stock image library, giving you access to several customizable templates.

Placeit is easy to use and offers a variety of templates for different purposes, including outros for news stories, video blogs, and even gaming videos. The platform offers an unlimited subscription plan starting from **$7.47 /month.**

However, the design rendering process of the editor is slow, there is no AI tool, and you even cannot import fonts that are not available on the platform.
