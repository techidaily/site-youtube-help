## Part1: Intros

#### Elements of an Intro

Intros should only last about five seconds, and that can be cut down to two or three if you have a larger following.

When your intro video is longer than five seconds viewers are more likely to click away. The first 15 seconds of a video is when viewers are most likely to decide to click on one of the recommended videos, or go back to their search results and choose something else. The odds of them leaving within these first 15 seconds are greater if you do not get right to the main point of your video. That is why long intro sequences are bad for your watch time.

Whether it is better to put your intro at the very beginning of your video, or after you introduce your topic, will depend on your viewers. You may want to try it both ways and then look at your retention report (found in your YouTube Creator Studio under Analytics) to see which works best for you.

#### [Top Intro Sites](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

There are a few different sites where you can download animated intros, customized to include your username or logo. Here are two of the best:

**FlixPress.com**

This is probably the most popular intro site. There are a lot of great animated intros available for under $5, or even for free.

**IntroMaker.net**

This is another site with really professional looking intros for $5\. They only have two free options, though.

#### Creating an Intro in Filmora

You can create a simple intro card in **Filmora**.

1. Choose your background. You may want to use a short clip as your intro, or you may just want a colored background.
2. Drag your clip or background into the video track of your timeline and trim it down to five seconds.
3. If you have a logo, import it into Filmora and drag it into your picture-in-picture track.
4. With your logo selected, click on the Green Screen icon. In the pop-up, select the background of your logo to make it transparent. For this to work your logo cannot be the same color as its background.
5. Click on the editing icon with your logo selected and choose an animation.
6. Go to the Text/Titles menu and choose an animated title that suits your channel. Drag it into your text track and edit it to include your name.
7. The last piece of your intro is sound. You can choose a song from Filmora’s library and cut it down to five seconds, or import your sound effect.
8. Export your video and save it for use in all of your other videos.

## Part 2: End Cards

When your video ends, YouTube will recommend a selection of videos users may want to watch next. Often, these recommendations will not include more of your videos.

To keep viewers on your channel, you can create your End Card which recommends other content you have created.

#### Elements of an End Card

An end card includes clips from two or three of your videos, muted, and shrunk down to thumbnail-size. Using spotlight annotations you can make these thumbnails click-able.

It is also important that your end card includes multiple calls to action. A call to action is meant to spur a viewer to some kind of action. Writing ‘Check out this video’ above one of your thumbnails is a call to action.

You should also have a subscribe link somewhere in your end card, ideally a very noticeable button with a proven call to action like ‘Subscribe Now!’.

Some creators will leave their end cards at that and play music overtop, but it can be even more effective to include a voiceover where you ask viewers to subscribe and watch your other videos.

#### [How To Make an End Card](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

1. Choose a static background. You may want to download an end card template or create one in a drawing program. If you do, make sure to include calls to action like ‘Watch more!’ and ‘Subscribe’.
2. Drag your background into your timeline at the end of your video.
3. Import two or three of your previous videos and drag them into your picture in picture tracks. Each clip should be on its track.
4. Trim the clips in your picture in picture track down to the same length as your end card.
5. Shrink your clips down to thumbnail-size by dragging their corners in the preview window.
6. Position your clips so they are spaced evenly by dragging them in the preview screen.
7. Mute your clips.
8. If your background does not include any calls to action, choose a title from the **Text/Titles** menu in Filmora and create at least two – one asking viewers to subscribe, and one asking them to watch your suggested videos.
9. Export your video from Filmora and upload it to YouTube.
10. Go to your **Video Manager** and select **Annotations** in the drop-down menu next to your video.
11. Go to your end card in the previewer, as that is where you want to add your annotations.
12. Click **Add Annotation** and add a spotlight annotation to your video. Stretch it over one of your thumbnails and then check the Link box under your Annotation’s timing. Insert a link to the video you are previewing.
13. Repeat for any other thumbnails. For your subscribe button, change where it said ‘Video’ to ‘Subscribe’ and enter your channel URL.
14. Click **Apply Changes**.

## The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos

Creating 3D animations from scratch is far from easy since you are going to need to be familiar with both the animation techniques and the animation software you’re using to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos. That’s why some of the intro makers, we included in this article, offer customizable templates that enable you to create stunning intros for your videos with ease. So, let’s get started.

#### 1. [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

This is an online platform that features hundreds of templates created by the platform’s users. Some of these templates are free to use, while some creators ask for a credit if you want to open your video with their intro. Each of the templates can be customized in accordance with the demands of your project from the platform’s Clipmaker, and you can even create your own account where you can save all your projects. After you’ve selected an intro you like, you can pick a new environment, insert new text and change its font, size or appearance, among other things. You can also adjust the Position, Rotation or Shake options in the Camera menu, and you can upload your own music, apply the fade in and fade out sound effects or adjust the sound volume from the Audio tab. When done, you should head over to the Download menu where you choose the Render Mode, and the format of the file you’re rendering before you save a watermark-free video to your computer.

#### 2. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Linux, Windows, macOS

Creating visual effects, tracking objects or making 3D intros for your YouTube videos are just a few, among numerous things you can do with Blender.

Moreover, you can develop the tools and add-ons on your own and customize the interface in virtually any way you want. Nonetheless, you must be a proficient 3D modeler and animator in order to be able to use Blender to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos, as the tools the software offers can be overwhelming for inexperienced users. On the other hand, Blender may be one of the best 3D creation suites around, so if you have plenty of experience with modeling, animation, compositing or motion tracking you should try creating 3D intros with this powerful software.

#### 3. [Renderforest](https://www.renderforest.com/)

**Price:** Free, subscription plans start at $9,99 for a single export

**Compatibility:** web-based

You can use Renderforest for much more than just making intros, as the platform offers the tools for logo creation, video editing, and website design. The platform also contains a huge intro the collection you can use free of charge. What’s more, you can customize each intro by changing the text, adjusting its colors or adding a voice-over. Renderforest lets you use its music library to create a soundtrack for the intro, or you can upload your own music from a computer and add it to the intro you’re making. Downloading the intros and all other videos you make with Renderforest is not possible unless you create an account. In addition, all the visual content you produce with the free version of Renderforest is going to be watermarked and in relatively poor resolution, which is why you have to select a subscription plan that allows you to get rid of the watermark and download videos in high-resolution.

#### 4. [MotionDen](https://motionden.com/)

**Price:** Free, subscription plans start at $9,00

**Compatibility:** web-based

Making 2D animations, birthday videos, commercials, logo animations or 3D intros for YouTube videos on the MotionDen platform is easy.

MotionDen is a great source of material for all YouTube content creators who don’t want to spend a lot of time creating 3D intros from scratch and would rather quickly customize a template before adding it to their project.
