YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?

![youtube shorts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG)

Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.

The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down

* Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.
* YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.
* YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.
* From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.

## **Part 3\. How to Start Earning from YouTube Shorts**

Eligible creators start earning from YouTube Shorts when they opt-in to the program. You need to make sure you are eligible and agree to start receiving revenue from your creations.

When you become eligible, follow these steps to apply for the YPP program:

* Sign in to YouTube on a computer or the YouTube Studio app on a mobile
* Click on your profile picture, and choose YouTube Studio
* Click Earn on the left menu, then select Apply
* Click Start to review your eligibility and accept the base terms
* Click Start to set up an AdSense account. You may also choose to link an existing active one.
* Your application will be in Progress in the Get Reviewed step.

Once you have completed these steps, your YouTube Channel will be reviewed. You can expect to hear a decision within a month of enrolling you in the program.

### **How to opt in for YouTube Shorts Monetization**

After being approved and enrolled in the YPP program, you need to opt in to monetize your channel. Remember that you will not be automatically signed up for the ad revenue-sharing model. Here are a few more steps you need to take:

* Sign in to YouTube Studio
* Select Earn in the left menu
* Click Get Started for every module to review and accept their terms
* Accept the Base Terms and the Shorts Monetization Module to monetize Shorts

Once your Shorts are monetized, track the progress and amount of money earned through YouTube Analytics.

### **Other Ways to Monetize YouTube Shorts**

The YPP program is the only ad-based monetization option for YouTube Shorts. However, there are other ways of earning:

* **Selling Subscription Memberships:** Turn your YouTube to membership and charge monthly payments in exchange for perks like badges and exclusive content.
* **Monetize Livestreams:** Features such as super stickers and super chat allow creators to make money when fans pay to send highlighted messages.
* **Selling Merchandise and Products:** Make additional income by selling branded merchandise like apparel or product lines in your content niche.
* **Secure Paid Brand Partnerships**: Interacting directly with brands and negotiating sponsorship deals.
* **Join an Affiliate Program**: An affiliate program will pay you revenue associated with clicks to links hosted on your channel.
