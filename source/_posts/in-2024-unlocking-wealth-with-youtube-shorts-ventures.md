## Methods to add a subscribe button to your video

Viewers are not likely to subscribe to any channel if they are not guided. One best method is to engage a subscribe button to your video and draw the attention of as many as possible.

#### 1 Use Subscribe Green Screen

Put your green screen to work by subscribing to it. Follow these steps to produce eye-catching videos, with a call to action closing point.

**Step 1\. Set screen**

Lighting is important to facilitate high-resolution video output quality. Put appropriate lighting settings to avoid directional shadows and get the best results.

**Step 3\. Set up the subject**  
Give ample space between the subject and the green screen for an effective outcome. If they are too close, there will be a reflection of the green screen on the subject. It isn't professional as it will be hard when it comes to matching to a different background.
