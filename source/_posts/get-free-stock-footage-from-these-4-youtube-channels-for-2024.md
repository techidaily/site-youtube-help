You make your original content, so it might not be obvious why you would want stock footage. Stock footage doesnâ€™t replace your own recorded videos, though, it just supplements them by adding a bit of variety. Stock video footage is especially useful for things like intros and transitions.

Here are 4 YouTube channels where you can find free stock footage. To learn how to download videos directly from YouTube, check out the tutorial **[here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

**Royalty-free Video Footage:**

[1\. Free Stock Footage Archive](#freestockfootage)

[2\. Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage](#beachfront)

[3\. HDStockFootageFree](#hdstock)

[4\. NatureClip: Free Stock Footage](#natureclip)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **1\. [Free Stock Footage Archive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy8fgmCsEDIKMWx4Zi0CvNQ/featured)**

This channel has a massive library of free stock footage, which is updated semi-regularly. They have backgrounds, â€˜glitchâ€™ effects (which look really cool when combined with [Filmoraâ€™s green screen tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)), and more classic stock footage options like street scenes and forests. Thereâ€™s a particularly interesting playlist of black and white videos, which could be useful if youâ€™re trying to make a darker or creepier project.

Besides video footage, this archive also has some sound effects.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **2\. [Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage](https://www.youtube.com/user/Beachfrontprod/featured)**

This stock footage channel has lots of nature scenes and wildlife. Thereâ€™s some urban and technology stuff too, but their nature stuff is especially great. Itâ€™s easy to find what youâ€™re looking for on Beachfront B-Roll because they have themed playlists for different seasons, as well as for things like â€˜skyâ€™ or â€˜waterâ€™.

On their **[website](http://www.beachfrontbroll.com/)**, you can find even more content and multiple download options.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **3\. [HDStockFootageFree](https://www.youtube.com/user/HDStockFootageFree)**

This channel doesnâ€™t have a large variety of different kinds of footage â€“ all of it is pretty industrial. Thereâ€™s footage of trains, trucks, trash, and people working. Itâ€™s the kind of stuff that you might not find on other stock footage channels because itâ€™s not necessarily pretty.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **4\. [NatureClip: Free Stock Footage](https://www.youtube.com/user/NatureClip)**

The name of this channel pretty much says it all. Theyâ€™ve got tons of great nature videos, including scenery, animals, flowers, and views. Itâ€™s not all everyday nature either, theyâ€™ve got cool macro shots of bugs, and a lot of more exotic animals. One particularly noteworthy playlist is devoted entirely to slow-motion clips.

If you know of anywhere else, people can get free stock footage, say so in the comments!

If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software **Wondershare Filmora**. It provides special effects, stock photo & video, sound library, etc., which will definitely enhance your productivity and helps to make money by making videos much accessible.

Streaming online videos on YouTube has become a lifestyle for almost all of us now. But time and data usage are huge constraints. Isnâ€™t it annoying when you find free Wi-Fi but lack a suitable video downloader or you have a downloader but no Wi-Fi access at the moment to stream the videos. You may already know how to [download mp3 on Android](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), to solve your dilemma and let you download YouTube videos on your Android phone, we have collected the most popular **YouTube video downloader for Android** in this article.

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## Part 1: Online Video Downloader App Only Supporting YouTube video

#### 1. [TubeMate](http://www.androidfreeware.net/download-youtube-tubemate.html)

Using TubeMate, you can now save your favorite YouTube videos directly on your phone and cherish them anywhere offline. You can choose the quality of the video as this tool supports different resolutions. If you are a novice user this App is simple as one two three, you need to search the video on YouTube and tap the green arrow at the bottom of the screen to download it.

![tubemate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/TubeMate.png)

Pros:

* Multiple download options are available, along with the background download option to carry on with other routine work on your phone.
* It can download the video as well as audio.
* Videos can be converted to MP3 format.

Cons:

* It cannot download in 4K format.
* TubeMate doesnâ€™t download the original YouTube video, but rather a video encoded video by YouTube. Hence, the video sometimes fails to play, and downloading a low-resolution video to save YouTube videos on Android might help.
