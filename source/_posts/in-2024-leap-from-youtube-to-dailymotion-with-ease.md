## What are YouTube Shorts?

YouTube Shorts is an app feature in YouTube that was introduced in 2020\. It has so far rolled out in more than 100 countries. It enables both artists and creators to compose short videos to express any feeling. It could be for entertainment or educational purposes. However, the videos are short, not exceeding 60 seconds, with a default length of 15 seconds. You also have the option to record your videos with music to add value to your video.

YouTube Shorts has two main features; a platform to watch short videos and a tool you can use to compose your own short-form videos. To watch the clip, just go to the “Homepage” and find several thumbnails for popular Shorts. Then click on a video and land on the vertical video player to watch the video. Likewise, you can use the thumbs up or down to like or dislike the video. Additionally, you can pause the video and post a comment or share the Shorts with other fans.

#### 5\. Do artists earn royalties from Shorts?

Yes. Artists do receive some revenue from their music if creators use their songs in YouTube Short videos. Royalties come from ad revenue but it will depend on the type of ad on the video. So, more popular videos get higher rates than non-popular ones.

#### 6\. What to post on YouTube Shorts?

You can post several videos to YouTube Shorts which include:

* **Tutorials:** teach your viewers via YouTube Shorts.
* **Confessional videos:** This is when you speak to your viewers about what you are passionate about.
* **Entertainment videos:** You can also entertain your viewers with funny videos.

#### 7\. Can I promote my music on YouTube Shorts?

YouTube Shorts is a perfect platform to promote your music if you are an artist. You can either hire an influencer or do it yourself as an artist. These tips will help you to successfully promote your brand.

**Be precise:** Condense all the important details in your video and ensure the background music aligns with the theme.

**Think widely:** Check at what others are adding to their Shorts. You can include memes and other entertaining clips.

**Post videos more often:** Since YouTube Shorts are short videos that can’t accommodate so much information, try to post your videos more often so that your viewers follow up closely on what you are putting across.

**Use catchy music:** It doesn’t mean that the latest singles are more catchy or viral. Songs from a few years ago can also be equally catchy.

#### 8\. How are YouTube Shorts different from other short-form videos?

YouTube streaming service is already a popular platform that provides tones of music and video clips. Encompassing Shorts just pushed it at the forefront. The userbase is readily available and any Shorts you post will be widely viewed in over 100 countries. More so, you can extract music from the platform for use on your Shorts videos.
