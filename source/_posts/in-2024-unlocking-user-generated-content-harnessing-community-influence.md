## **[Richard Harrington on Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/Rich-Harrington/120-1.html)**

Lynda isn‚Äôt free, but the 10-day free trial period is definitely long enough for you to watch this two-hour course.

What‚Äôs great about this course is that it assumes you have no animation experience, and it walks you through the main thing a lot of YouTubers want to learn animation for ‚Äì creating an animated logo.

## **[Bloop Animation](https://www.bloopanimation.com/)**

 Most of the video animation courses on this site are paid, but they have a lot of cool free tutorials as well. The focus is more on animating figures/cartoons than video effects, but if you have any interest in animation more generally then this is a great place to start learning. They even have a free ebook you can download which is targeted at beginners.

Do you like the animated elements in Wondershare Filmora? Do you want to learn how to make your own?

A little while ago, we posted a list of YouTube channels where you could [get free green screen effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). All of these effects consisted of animations on green backgrounds. To use them, you pull the clip into the PIP track of your Filmora project and use the green screen feature to make the background transparent. It‚Äôs pretty easy.

In this post, we‚Äôre going to kick things up a bit. Here is a list of places where you can get free lessons on creating your own animated video effects.
