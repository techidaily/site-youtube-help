### Reasons to Use Videos for Product or Brand Promotion

The modern market demands a strategy that will present your brand and its services in a flattering light because if your public image doesn't seem trustworthy, your potential business partners might opt to use the services of your competitors. Including an Explainer video on the homepage of your company's website may increase conversion rates up to 80%, because it will enable you to share the values that are essential for your brand with each and every visitor to your website.

Furthermore, we all know how important Google Search Rankings are for the online visibility of products, companies and anything else on the Internet. Videos can increase your' company's chances to land on the first page in the Google searches by 53%, which means that your concerns about search rankings on Google can be reduced by producing engaging and fun to watch promotional videos.

Digital video content can be easily uploaded to video sharing platforms and distributed across social networks, and if the videos are engaging enough, even 76% of users will share your branded content. Well-crafted, skillfully written and produced videos will catch the eye of the public which is exactly what companies that want to grow more popular need.

### The Perks of Unique Content

Thinking that all videos are the same, is perhaps the biggest misconception you can have about social video marketing. The type of the video you'll need to produce in order to attract the attention to your company's services is directly related to the content you want to feature in that video. Demonstration videos are perfectly suited for display of the product's capabilities, while customer testimonials will enable you to share first-hand experiences of your loyal customers with the rest of the world.

Everyone wants to hear a tale well told, and choosing the Internet as a place where your videos will be shown is the right choice, since 39% of company executives will call the service provider after watching a video that tells the story of your brand. Business relies on trust, which makes establishing a strong connection to your target group all the more important, and moving images are much more likely to establish that connection than written content. Furthermore, an average Internet user spends 16 minutes per day watching online video ads, make sure that at least one minute belongs to you, through unique and thought-provoking content.

### Social Media as Means of Reaching Larger Audiences

If no one knows about your brand, then it is hard to sell the services you are offering, regardless of how world-changing they are. Social media has allowed us to have our voices heard around the world, which is the reason why all companies that aim to increase their sales should use it to distribute their video content.

YouTube has recently reported that mobile video consumption has increased by 100% each year in the last several years. This fact proves that reaching people wherever they are is no longer a dream. Keep in mind that a single minute of video is worth 1.8 million words to your clients because it keeps your messages short and effective.

Many people find it challenging to create compelling video advertisements for their brand promotions. While some of the creative tools might be expensive, the easy ones have a steep learning curve, and engaging a professional designer wouldn’t be something you might be ready for. **YouTube Video Builder** is a great solution for any such situation.

With that being said, the following sections talk about what **YouTube Video Builder** is, how is it useful, what advantages does it offer, and how can you create professional video adverts using the tool.

* [Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?](#part1)
* [Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Get YouTube Video Builder?](#part3)
* [Part 4: How to Make Video Ads for Free with YouTube Video Builder?](#part4)
* [Part 5: Tips for Making Good Video Ads with YouTube Video Builder](#part5)

## Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?

YouTube recently came up with an online tool, **YouTube Video Builder**, that, as the name suggests, enables you as an organization to prepare videos for free. These videos could be anywhere from 6 to 15 seconds long and are most appropriate for advertisements. Once created, the films can be used in the campaigns to promote your brand and/or products online.

However, you must keep the following few things handy before starting with **YouTube Video Builder** to prepare a video advertisement:

* **Logo**

You must have a good-quality photo of your [brand logo](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that you want to add to the video as a watermark. This gives your organization online recognition.

* **HD Images**

At the time of this writing, **YouTube Video Builder** only allows you to add still images. The tool compiles these photos using a theme that you select, and enables you to add background music to make the advert more engaging. Therefore, it is imperative to have high-definition images of your product(s) that you want to create a promotional video for.

* **Google Chrome Browser**

You must have the latest version of the Google Chrome web browser installed on your computer.

* **YouTube Channel**

Because **YouTube Video Builder** will publish your video advertisements on YouTube itself, you must have your own [YouTube Channel created](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), configured, and properly functioning so the posting process remains smooth and seamless.

* **Availability of the Tool and Features**

**YouTube Video Builder** is still in the Beta phase, and therefore you may not have access to all the features that the tool has to offer. However, this majorly depends on the region of your residence. As of now, the utility is not even available in some countries of the world.

## Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?

As explained earlier, **YouTube Video Builder** is an online tool that works on the latest version of the Google Chrome browser. The web interface of the utility has separate blocks (or placeholders if you want to call them) for different types of images. For instance, there is a placeholder for your logo, and a couple of other blank slots where you can import the photos from your computer.

There are some text input fields that you can populate with the relevant information such as the name of the video, the product’s name that you wish to promote, and many other things. There is a storyboard at the bottom of the interface that helps give your video a theme and the alignment of the ingredients that you have imported from your computer.

Finally, you can add background music to the video from the royalty-free tracks that can be accessed from the built-in library, and you are all set to go.

## Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?

Because YouTube Video Builder is in its Beta phase, at the time of this writing you are required to send an access request to Google using your account that you want to use to create the videos from. You can send your requests to: <https://services.google.com/fb/forms/videobuilderbeta/>.

Once your request is approved, you can then use the same Google account to sign in to the **YouTube Video Builder** portal, and start preparing your video advertisements. Here, it is important to understand that the Google account that you use to send an access request and prepare the videos must be the same ID that has your active and functional YouTube Channel.

## Part 4: How to Make Video Ads for Free with YouTube Video Builder?

Once you have access to the Beta version of **YouTube Video Builder**, you can start creating the video ads for free. You can learn the process of how this can be done by following the simple instructions given below:

#### Step 1: Prepare a Console

After signing in to your **YouTube Video Builder** account, on the main interface, click **Select Layout** from the navigation bar at the right if not already selected, pick a layout that best suits your needs, and click **Use Layout**.

![ YouTube Video Builder ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-select-layout.jpg)

Next, from the **Color & Logo** section, choose the base (background) and text colors using their corresponding tools from under the **Brand colors** section.

![Create video with YouTube Video Builder ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-select-color-logo.jpg)

After this, insert an image of your brand logo in the block under the **Logos** category.

![Create video with YouTube Video Builder ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-insert-brand-logo.jpg)

#### Step 2: Add the Ingredients

When you are on the **Images & Text** section of the navigation bar, pick the high-definition photos from the **Storyboard** at the bottom, and add them to the **Image 1**, **Image 2**, and **Image 3** boxes accordingly.

![Create video with YouTube Video Builder ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-insert-images-texts.jpg)

Now, scroll down to the **Text** section, and add the relevant content in the available text input fields. Make sure to add a compelling **Call to action** text to give the viewers a free passage to connect with you.

![Create video with YouTube Video Builder with CTA ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-call-to-action-texts.jpg)

#### Step 3: Make Cosmetic Manipulations

From the **Pick a Font** section of the navigation bar, click the **Google Fonts catalog** link to search for a unique font, and once found, type its name in the available field to use that font.

![Create video with YouTube Video Builder - change font ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-pickup-video-text-fonts.jpg)

Alternatively, you can leave the default one selected. When on the **Select Music** section, choose your preferred background music from the drop-down list that is present under the section.

![Create video with YouTube Video Builder with music ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-select-music-for-video.jpg)

Finally, click **Create video**, and wait while **YouTube Video Builder** takes you to the **Preview, Save, Share** section, and generates your video.

![ YouTube Video Builder Video create video  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-create-video.jpg)

#### Step 4: Save the Video and Begin Promotion

After the video is generated, play to preview the film. If everything looks good, click **Save video**.

![ YouTube Video Builder Video Preview and Save  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-save-preview-video.jpg)

On the next page, click **Copy** to copy the video link, and share it with your friends, colleagues, and family members for their feedback.

![ YouTube Video Builder Video Copy Link  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-copy-link.jpg)

Next, scroll down to get to the **Create Campaign** section of the navigation bar, and from the left screen, click **Create campaign** to begin a campaign to promote your brand and/or product(s).

![ YouTube Video Builder Video Create Campaign ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-create-campaign.jpg)

#### Part 5: Tips for Making Good Video Ads with YouTube Video Builder

The whole point here is to prepare your video adverts with the least investment and almost no effort. The following few tips would help you achieve this with ease:

* Make sure to gather all the ingredients such as the photos of the products, brand logo, etc. before starting with the video creation process
* Set a layout, font, theme color, and background music that compliments the product(s) you wish to promote
* Remain consistent with the theme color, fonts, etc. throughout the video
* Make sure to include a catchy ‘Call for action’ text in your video ad
* Make as many modifications as you want before publishing the ad on your YouTube Channel. Avoid doing any amendments after the ad has been posted
* Share the link of your video with as many people as you possibly can to make your product(s) and brand visible and popular
* Make sure to use the ad in your campaigns to make people aware of your brand/product(s)

**Conclusion**

The bitter truth is, producing videos, especially for brand promotions requires expert creators, expensive tools, and a good amount of work experience. Although all these can be managed if you have some spare funds, **YouTube Video Builder** helps you create advertising videos of up to 15 seconds with ease and for free. All you need is access to **YouTube Video Builder**, your own YouTube Channel, your brand logo, and high-definition photos of your product(s).

Many people find it challenging to create compelling video advertisements for their brand promotions. While some of the creative tools might be expensive, the easy ones have a steep learning curve, and engaging a professional designer wouldn’t be something you might be ready for. **YouTube Video Builder** is a great solution for any such situation.

With that being said, the following sections talk about what **YouTube Video Builder** is, how is it useful, what advantages does it offer, and how can you create professional video adverts using the tool.

## Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?

YouTube recently came up with an online tool, **YouTube Video Builder**, that, as the name suggests, enables you as an organization to prepare videos for free. These videos could be anywhere from 6 to 15 seconds long and are most appropriate for advertisements. Once created, the films can be used in the campaigns to promote your brand and/or products online.

However, you must keep the following few things handy before starting with **YouTube Video Builder** to prepare a video advertisement:

* **Logo**

You must have a good-quality photo of your [brand logo](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that you want to add to the video as a watermark. This gives your organization online recognition.

* **HD Images**

At the time of this writing, **YouTube Video Builder** only allows you to add still images. The tool compiles these photos using a theme that you select, and enables you to add background music to make the advert more engaging. Therefore, it is imperative to have high-definition images of your product(s) that you want to create a promotional video for.

* **Google Chrome Browser**

You must have the latest version of the Google Chrome web browser installed on your computer.

* **YouTube Channel**

Because **YouTube Video Builder** will publish your video advertisements on YouTube itself, you must have your own [YouTube Channel created](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), configured, and properly functioning so the posting process remains smooth and seamless.

* **Availability of the Tool and Features**

**YouTube Video Builder** is still in the Beta phase, and therefore you may not have access to all the features that the tool has to offer. However, this majorly depends on the region of your residence. As of now, the utility is not even available in some countries of the world.

## Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?

As explained earlier, **YouTube Video Builder** is an online tool that works on the latest version of the Google Chrome browser. The web interface of the utility has separate blocks (or placeholders if you want to call them) for different types of images. For instance, there is a placeholder for your logo, and a couple of other blank slots where you can import the photos from your computer.

There are some text input fields that you can populate with the relevant information such as the name of the video, the product’s name that you wish to promote, and many other things. There is a storyboard at the bottom of the interface that helps give your video a theme and the alignment of the ingredients that you have imported from your computer.

Finally, you can add background music to the video from the royalty-free tracks that can be accessed from the built-in library, and you are all set to go.

## Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?
