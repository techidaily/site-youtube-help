 We have mentioned before about [the equipment you should have to start your YouTube video shooting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), however, being methodical in your approach to the video making process and knowing exactly what and where you are going to stage and record will increase the quality of the content. Focus on the technical aspects of your YouTube video before you actually start shooting and strive to be well prepared for all the challenges a day on the set may bring.

 These and other useful tips may help you make better videos for your YouTube channel, so let's explore different ways of improving your video making skills.

## 10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos

 All videographers agree that you shouldn't come to the set unprepared. Everything has to be in its place, no matter how insignificant it may seem, because a tiny detail can completely ruin the shot or even an entire day of work. These tips are going to help you avoid common mistakes, inexperienced video producers often make.

#### 1. Write the Script

 Everything starts with a script, at least in the cinematography world. You don't have to write long, detailed descriptions of all scenes, just make a short note of every scene, what is being said in the shot, on-screen actions, camera positions, and so on. By doing this, you'll save yourself a lot of valuable time, you can then dedicate to other burning issues on the set. Besides, knowing what you are going to say throughout the video so you don't have to improvise all the time is going to help you feel more relaxed in front of a camera.

#### 2. Build the Set (Lighting included)

 Don't leave anything to chance. You should control everything that is going to be in the shot, so avoid working at locations you can't at least partially control. Shooting in studio-like conditions will enable you to carefully select the scenography and to design light so it matches the scene perfectly. The actors must always be clearly visible to the audience, which is why you need to pay attention to where they are located in the shot and how much light you have in that part of the shot.

#### 3. Keep Your Batteries Charged

 There is nothing more frustrating than arriving at the set anxious to start shooting just to find out that the batteries are empty. Charge the batteries at the end of each day on the set, because the chances are that you are going to need them early in the morning. Always have several spare batteries with you, so even if one battery is empty you have the replacement ready. You can also prolong the battery life by switching the camera off when you are not recording.

#### 4. Do a Microphone Check

 Capturing audio with an external microphone drastically increases the quality of the sound in your videos. That's why making absolutely sure that all cables are connected and that the microphone is perfectly placed is paramount if you want to get the sound right. The host or the hosts of the video must be at the right distance from the microphone, usually, the length of their fist with the thumb and pinky finger extended, but this can vary a few inches to either side.

#### 5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition

 The rule of thirds is a common composition principle used by videographers to create balanced and unified images. The rule suggests that the subjects in a shot should be placed at the intersections of the lines that divide the screen. Most digital cameras have a grid that makes using the rule of thirds quite simple because you can easily see when the subjects in the shot are not positioned correctly.

 This is just one of many shot composition techniques you have at your disposal, and as you gain more experience you'll learn how to combine them and get aesthetically pleasing results.

#### 6. Always Record Videos in Landscape Mode

 Posting vertically oriented videos to your YouTube channel will make you look unprofessional because portrait mode is never used for capturing videos. YouTubers who record their videos with Smartphones are more likely to fall into this trap, but all you need to do to avoid this is remember to hold the device horizontally.

 By switching to portrait mode, you'll be cropping the frame in a way, so you might unknowingly end up removing parts of the shot you wanted to record.

#### 7. Eliminate The Background Noises

 Professional microphones can pick up even the softest sounds, that might prove difficult to remove in the post-production. You can reduce the noise levels in your videos by using shotgun microphones that only capture sounds that come directly into the microphone, or by using the omnidirectional mic to eliminate the wind if you're shooting on an outdoor location.

 Background noises can be particularly unpleasant when recording narration, because the viewers of the video may not want to watch it until the end if they can't hear what the person in the video is saying.

 If it is hard for you to record your YouTube video in quite environment, you can [remove the background noise]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/remove-background-noise-from-video.html ) by using some video editing software.

#### 8. Keep The Shot in Focus

 You can always keep the shot in focus by simply enabling the autofocus feature, but if you do so you won't be able to control where the focus is going to be. Pulling focus manually is an art that takes years to master, and you have to keep practicing it as much as you can in order to become good at it.

 The best way to deal with out of focus shots is to avoid shooting scenes that include a lot of action because you won't have to pull focus that often.

#### 9. Put The Camera on a Tripod

![Camera tripod ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cartoni-omega-professional-tripod-system.jpg)

 The footage you produce should be smooth and free of camera shakes. All video cameras pick up vibrations easily, so even the slightest movement or impact can ruin a shot. Putting the camera on a tripod is one of the best ways to stabilize the shot and avoid camera shaking.

 In addition, a tripod enables you to maintain image stability even when shooting form lower or upper angles, something that cannot be achieved by simply holding the camera.

#### 10. Find The Best Angle

 Every scene has its perfect angle, you just have to find it. This job is much easier if you have already built the set and adjusted the lighting before approaching the shot selection process because it will allow you to know exactly where the camera should be.

 The camera position depends on a number of factors, including the video's aesthetics or the action that takes place in the shot, and you have to go through this process for each shot in your video.

 If it is hard for you to record your YouTube video in quite environment, you can [remove the background noise]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/remove-background-noise-from-video.html ) by using some video editing software.

#### 8. Keep The Shot in Focus

 You can always keep the shot in focus by simply enabling the autofocus feature, but if you do so you won't be able to control where the focus is going to be. Pulling focus manually is an art that takes years to master, and you have to keep practicing it as much as you can in order to become good at it.

 The best way to deal with out of focus shots is to avoid shooting scenes that include a lot of action because you won't have to pull focus that often.

#### 9. Put The Camera on a Tripod

![Camera tripod ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cartoni-omega-professional-tripod-system.jpg)

 The footage you produce should be smooth and free of camera shakes. All video cameras pick up vibrations easily, so even the slightest movement or impact can ruin a shot. Putting the camera on a tripod is one of the best ways to stabilize the shot and avoid camera shaking.

 In addition, a tripod enables you to maintain image stability even when shooting form lower or upper angles, something that cannot be achieved by simply holding the camera.

 We have chosen some of the [best tripods that you can use for starting a YouTube vlogging Video shooting]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/how-to-use-tripod-for-vlogging.html). If you are using a 4K camera, here are some [tripods that you can use for your 4K Cameras]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/4k/best-tripods-for-4k-camera.html).

#### 10. Find The Best Angle

 Every scene has its perfect angle, you just have to find it. This job is much easier if you have already built the set and adjusted the lighting before approaching the shot selection process because it will allow you to know exactly where the camera should be.

 The camera position depends on a number of factors, including the video's aesthetics or the action that takes place in the shot, and you have to go through this process for each shot in your video.

If you watch YouTube then you donâ€™t need to be told why itâ€™s a good idea for creators to collaborate. You get the chance to grow by being introduced to your partnerâ€™s audience, you make a friend to support and be supported by as you both grow your channels, and it always looks like a ton of fun. The question isnâ€™t why you should collab, itâ€™s how.

Finding someone to collab with, approaching them, and figuring out how to actually make the video can be all be challenging. Here are some tips:

## **6 Tips About Finding Collab Partners**

Here are 6 questions you should ask yourself when youâ€™re looking for potential collaborators on YouTube.

#### **1\. Who Are My Friends?**

The easiest way to think of a potential collab partner is just to think of who youâ€™re already friendly with. The best place to look for collab partners is probably in your list of subscribers. Someone who already knows what you do and enjoys it will probably be receptive to the idea of doing a video with you.

You can even sort your own subscribers by their sub counts to find someone with about the same sized channel as you.

#### **2\. Whoâ€™s In The Same Boat as Me?**

You donâ€™t have to already have a friendship, or even a creator-subscriber, relationship with someone to consider them as a potential partner (although itâ€™s not a bad idea to subscribe to them before you send your request).

Consider people who are in the same niche as you who have approximately the same sized channel as you. If youâ€™re in different genres the collab doesnâ€™t make sense, and if thereâ€™s a significant size difference between your channels then itâ€™s a lot more valuable to one of you than the other.

#### **3\. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?**

Part of why you collaborate is to grow your audience, but that should never be at the expense of your current subscriber base. Before you reach out to a potential collab partner, seriously consider whether you think your audience will enjoy a video that features them.

Your partner should be someone who delivers content that is relevant to your own audience (for example, it makes no sense for a tech YouTuber to collaborate with someone whose channel is about cupcakes â€“ their techie audience doesnâ€™t want to learn about cupcakes).

#### **4\. Do I Like Their Videos?**

Before you send anyone a message, make sure youâ€™ve watched and enjoyed a few of their videos. If you donâ€™t find them entertaining then your audience probably wonâ€™t either. Also, if you donâ€™t seem to have any knowledge of someoneâ€™s content then they probably wonâ€™t want to work with you.

#### **5\. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?**

The time to start brainstorming is not after youâ€™ve already sent a collab request. You should think of a few ideas before you reach out, both to show your potential partner that youâ€™re serious and to ensure that your audience is getting well-planned content.

#### **6\. Whoâ€™s in My Area?**

You can do a long-distance collab, but if it is possible to physically meet up with someone to plan and shoot the videos then thatâ€™s way better.

## **How to Ask Someone to Collab**

![collab pitch examples](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/collab-pitch-examples.jpg)

Hereâ€™s an example of a collab pitch, and a template you can use to write your own! Itâ€™s from filmora.ioâ€™s free YouTube Toolkit, which you can [download with the Get Subs Guide here](https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers).

Here are some more tips:

#### **1\. Use Their Name**

This one probably seems basic, but it is very easy to send a message where you just say â€˜heyâ€™ and jump to your point without actually using someoneâ€™s name. Thatâ€™s a mistake in this scenario. You want to let your potential partner know that you are specifically interested in working with them and arenâ€™t just fishing for anyone who might work with you.

#### **2\. Mention Their Content**

Show an interest in your future partnerâ€™s videos. You should have watched at least a couple of them as part of deciding to reach out, so mention a video of theirs that you liked and talk about why. Let the other person know that you genuinely enjoy what they do and think your audience will too.

#### **3\. Pitch Video Ideas**

You should have a couple of ideas for videos you could do together ready when you contact someone. You donâ€™t want to reach out to someone and then seem like you expect them to do all the planning. You may not end up doing one of the ideas you pitch, but youâ€™ll still come off better if you have something in mind when you first send your message.

#### **4\. Keep Your Message Simple**

You donâ€™t want to overwhelm someone with a huge amount of text the first time you contact them. Check out the example at the beginning of this section to get an idea of the length you should go for.

#### **5\. Be an Equal**

Remember that you are just as wonderful a creator as the person you are approaching. You donâ€™t want to fawn too heavily and cast yourself more as a fan than a serious creator in your own right (not that you canâ€™t be both).

#### **6\. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page**

It usually isnâ€™t difficult to find contact information for a YouTuber. If you go to someoneâ€™s channel page and click into the About tab, there will usually be a section called â€˜For business inquiriesâ€™ under â€˜Detailsâ€™. Click â€˜View Email Addressâ€™ next to that and youâ€™ll have a means of contacting the person you want to collaborate with.

You can also reach out through DMs or other social media. If you use a platform like Twitter, however, you may want to be a bit more casual and start a conversation before building up to asking them about a collab.

## **How to Make a Collab Video**

Here are 3 ways you can collaborate with other YouTubers.

#### **Shout Each Other Out**

This is the easiest way to collab because you donâ€™t have to meet up or do much planning together. Essentially, you just make your own video and let everyone know how much you like your partnerâ€™s channel (combined with linking your viewers to them), and they do the same.

Make sure to agree beforehand on how long youâ€™ll spend plugging each other in your videos, so one of you doesnâ€™t go on way longer than the other.

This probably isnâ€™t a hugely effective method of collaborating if your goal is to grow (I wouldnâ€™t check out someoneâ€™s channel just because I was told to), but it certainly is easy.

#### **Be Guests in Each Otherâ€™s Videos**

This might be the most fun type of collab to watch. The person whose channel the video appears on is the â€˜hostâ€™ and the video is done in something closer to their usual style (which will be more appealing to their subscribers), and their collab partner is a guest. You might want to do two of these videos so you each have one for your own channel.

 Depending on your YouTube niche, you might do a fun activity together or you might interview your guest about a subject you think your subscribers are interested in.

In order to pull off a collab like this, you need to be able to meet in person.

#### **Long Distance Collaborations**

 Itâ€™s harder to collab if you canâ€™t meet up, but it isnâ€™t impossible. You can exchange footage to use in each otherâ€™s videos, or you can record a Google Hangout or Skype chat.

## **Launching Your Collab**

Here are some tips for making sure both you and your partner get the most out of the collab videos you've made.

#### **Agree on a Launch Date/Time**

If you each have a video for your own channel then you want to make sure those go up at the same time. Itâ€™ll be awkward if you post your video and shout out your partner/their collab video and when people go to check that out it isnâ€™t up.

You may want to post your videos as unlisted initially if youâ€™re worried about one of you taking longer to upload. Then, once your videos are both completely ready to go, you can switch their listing to â€˜publicâ€™ at the exact same time.

#### **Promote Your Collab**

Before you post your collab videos, you might want to build hype by mentioning the upcoming collab video in your solo videos leading up to it. If you and your partner are active on platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, you can do things like post behind the scenes pictures of your collab videos to generate excitement.

#### **Comment on Each Otherâ€™s Videos**

After youâ€™ve posted your collabs, make sure to leave each other comments about how much fun it was working together. You might want to interact publicly on social media too. Overall, just be friends. You want to maintain this relationship to leave the door open to future collabs, and your viewers will want to believe in your friendship too. Your partner's subscribers are more likely to be interested in you when they feel like you're buddies with one of their favorite creators.

 Make sure to discuss how much promotion you'll each do for the collab before and after it launches. If one of you does a ton of promotion and the other just does one tweet, it won't make the person who's done way more promotion feel great.

Make sure to agree beforehand on how long youâ€™ll spend plugging each other in your videos, so one of you doesnâ€™t go on way longer than the other.

This probably isnâ€™t a hugely effective method of collaborating if your goal is to grow (I wouldnâ€™t check out someoneâ€™s channel just because I was told to), but it certainly is easy.

#### **Be Guests in Each Otherâ€™s Videos**

This might be the most fun type of collab to watch. The person whose channel the video appears on is the â€˜hostâ€™ and the video is done in something closer to their usual style (which will be more appealing to their subscribers), and their collab partner is a guest. You might want to do two of these videos so you each have one for your own channel.

 Depending on your YouTube niche, you might do a fun activity together or you might interview your guest about a subject you think your subscribers are interested in.

In order to pull off a collab like this, you need to be able to meet in person.

#### **Long Distance Collaborations**

 Itâ€™s harder to collab if you canâ€™t meet up, but it isnâ€™t impossible. You can exchange footage to use in each otherâ€™s videos, or you can record a Google Hangout or Skype chat.

## **Launching Your Collab**

Here are some tips for making sure both you and your partner get the most out of the collab videos you've made.

#### **Agree on a Launch Date/Time**

If you each have a video for your own channel then you want to make sure those go up at the same time. Itâ€™ll be awkward if you post your video and shout out your partner/their collab video and when people go to check that out it isnâ€™t up.

You may want to post your videos as unlisted initially if youâ€™re worried about one of you taking longer to upload. Then, once your videos are both completely ready to go, you can switch their listing to â€˜publicâ€™ at the exact same time.

#### **Promote Your Collab**

Before you post your collab videos, you might want to build hype by mentioning the upcoming collab video in your solo videos leading up to it. If you and your partner are active on platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, you can do things like post behind the scenes pictures of your collab videos to generate excitement.

#### **Comment on Each Otherâ€™s Videos**

After youâ€™ve posted your collabs, make sure to leave each other comments about how much fun it was working together. You might want to interact publicly on social media too. Overall, just be friends. You want to maintain this relationship to leave the door open to future collabs, and your viewers will want to believe in your friendship too. Your partner's subscribers are more likely to be interested in you when they feel like you're buddies with one of their favorite creators.

 Make sure to discuss how much promotion you'll each do for the collab before and after it launches. If one of you does a ton of promotion and the other just does one tweet, it won't make the person who's done way more promotion feel great.

If you watch YouTube then you donâ€™t need to be told why itâ€™s a good idea for creators to collaborate. You get the chance to grow by being introduced to your partnerâ€™s audience, you make a friend to support and be supported by as you both grow your channels, and it always looks like a ton of fun. The question isnâ€™t why you should collab, itâ€™s how.

Finding someone to collab with, approaching them, and figuring out how to actually make the video can be all be challenging. Here are some tips:

## **6 Tips About Finding Collab Partners**

Here are 6 questions you should ask yourself when youâ€™re looking for potential collaborators on YouTube.

#### **1\. Who Are My Friends?**

The easiest way to think of a potential collab partner is just to think of who youâ€™re already friendly with. The best place to look for collab partners is probably in your list of subscribers. Someone who already knows what you do and enjoys it will probably be receptive to the idea of doing a video with you.

You can even sort your own subscribers by their sub counts to find someone with about the same sized channel as you.

#### **2\. Whoâ€™s In The Same Boat as Me?**

You donâ€™t have to already have a friendship, or even a creator-subscriber, relationship with someone to consider them as a potential partner (although itâ€™s not a bad idea to subscribe to them before you send your request).

Consider people who are in the same niche as you who have approximately the same sized channel as you. If youâ€™re in different genres the collab doesnâ€™t make sense, and if thereâ€™s a significant size difference between your channels then itâ€™s a lot more valuable to one of you than the other.

#### **3\. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?**

Part of why you collaborate is to grow your audience, but that should never be at the expense of your current subscriber base. Before you reach out to a potential collab partner, seriously consider whether you think your audience will enjoy a video that features them.

Your partner should be someone who delivers content that is relevant to your own audience (for example, it makes no sense for a tech YouTuber to collaborate with someone whose channel is about cupcakes â€“ their techie audience doesnâ€™t want to learn about cupcakes).

#### **4\. Do I Like Their Videos?**

Before you send anyone a message, make sure youâ€™ve watched and enjoyed a few of their videos. If you donâ€™t find them entertaining then your audience probably wonâ€™t either. Also, if you donâ€™t seem to have any knowledge of someoneâ€™s content then they probably wonâ€™t want to work with you.

#### **5\. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?**

The time to start brainstorming is not after youâ€™ve already sent a collab request. You should think of a few ideas before you reach out, both to show your potential partner that youâ€™re serious and to ensure that your audience is getting well-planned content.

#### **6\. Whoâ€™s in My Area?**

You can do a long-distance collab, but if it is possible to physically meet up with someone to plan and shoot the videos then thatâ€™s way better.

## **How to Ask Someone to Collab**

![collab pitch examples](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/collab-pitch-examples.jpg)

Hereâ€™s an example of a collab pitch, and a template you can use to write your own! Itâ€™s from filmora.ioâ€™s free YouTube Toolkit, which you can [download with the Get Subs Guide here](https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers).

Here are some more tips:

#### **1\. Use Their Name**

This one probably seems basic, but it is very easy to send a message where you just say â€˜heyâ€™ and jump to your point without actually using someoneâ€™s name. Thatâ€™s a mistake in this scenario. You want to let your potential partner know that you are specifically interested in working with them and arenâ€™t just fishing for anyone who might work with you.

#### **2\. Mention Their Content**

Show an interest in your future partnerâ€™s videos. You should have watched at least a couple of them as part of deciding to reach out, so mention a video of theirs that you liked and talk about why. Let the other person know that you genuinely enjoy what they do and think your audience will too.

#### **3\. Pitch Video Ideas**

You should have a couple of ideas for videos you could do together ready when you contact someone. You donâ€™t want to reach out to someone and then seem like you expect them to do all the planning. You may not end up doing one of the ideas you pitch, but youâ€™ll still come off better if you have something in mind when you first send your message.

#### **4\. Keep Your Message Simple**

You donâ€™t want to overwhelm someone with a huge amount of text the first time you contact them. Check out the example at the beginning of this section to get an idea of the length you should go for.

#### **5\. Be an Equal**

Remember that you are just as wonderful a creator as the person you are approaching. You donâ€™t want to fawn too heavily and cast yourself more as a fan than a serious creator in your own right (not that you canâ€™t be both).

#### **6\. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page**

It usually isnâ€™t difficult to find contact information for a YouTuber. If you go to someoneâ€™s channel page and click into the About tab, there will usually be a section called â€˜For business inquiriesâ€™ under â€˜Detailsâ€™. Click â€˜View Email Addressâ€™ next to that and youâ€™ll have a means of contacting the person you want to collaborate with.

You can also reach out through DMs or other social media. If you use a platform like Twitter, however, you may want to be a bit more casual and start a conversation before building up to asking them about a collab.
