## Device-Friendly Tutorial: Inserting Your Shorts Into YouTube

# How to Upload Shorts Video on YouTube? \[2024\]

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Quite recently, YouTube launched Shorts to compete with Tik Tok. At the time of this writing, the users in India have access to the fully functional version of the app. Although YouTube Shorts is available for both Android and iOS platforms, its functions are limited as the application is still in its Beta phase for the remaining part of the globe.

With that said, the following sections explain the step-by-step process on **how to upload a short video on YouTube** Shorts both from your smartphone and a PC.

## Part 1: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube from PC?

The fact is, if you are using a computer to upload short videos to YouTube, the process is identical to publishing your other, regular footage. However, there are a few guidelines that your clips must comply with so that the streaming platform could specifically identify them as YouTube Shorts. These norms include:

* Your videos must not be more than 60 seconds long in duration
* They must be shot in portrait orientation, ideally in the 9:16 aspect ratio
* The title or the description must contain ‘#Shorts’ (without quotes) in it

Once you have a video recorded using the first two guidelines from the above list, you can use the instructions given below to upload the media on YouTube:

#### Step 1: Select a Short Video to Upload

![Upload YouTube Shorts Video to desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-short-videos-on-youtube-pc.jpg)

Launch your favorite web browser on your PC, go to YouTube, make sure to sign in to your YouTube account, click the **Create** (**Camera**) icon from the top-right corner of the web page, click **SELECT FILES** on the **Upload videos** window, and locate, select, and upload a short video from your PC to the portal.

![Upload YouTube Shorts Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-short-videos-interface-on-youtube-pc.jpg)

#### Step 2: Mark the Video as Short

On the **Details** window that appears, add **#Shorts** in the **Title** or **Description** field, optionally pick a thumbnail from the suggested images present under the **Thumbnail** section (or upload a custom picture from your PC), select your preferred radio button from under the **Audience** section, make the other necessary changes if need be, and click **NEXT**. When the **Video elements** window comes up, choose your preferred options and elements, click **NEXT**.

![Mark YouTube Shorts Video in title and description](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mark-shorts-videos-on-youtube-pc.jpg)

#### Step 3: Publish the Short Video

On the **Visibility** window, choose your preferred radio button from under the **Save or publish** section or select **Schedule** to set a different time when the short video should be published automatically. Finally, click **SAVE** to publish the clip as a short video on YouTube from your computer.

![post YouTube Shorts Video  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/publish-youtube-shorts-video-desktop.jpg)

To sum up, uploading YouTube Shorts video from desktop has nothing different from uploading regular YouTube video besides the requirements listed at the beginning of this article.

## Part 2: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube Mobile App?

The process of **uploading YouTube Shorts** from the mobile app is fairly simple compared to the method used on a computer. While using the app, you can either upload an existing video or shoot a new one from within the program itself then and there, add music and text, and upload it right away. Both these methods are explained below in detail:

**Note:** The guidelines for creating and uploading short videos to YouTube remain the same, regardless of the platform or device you use.

### Method 1: Upload an Existing Short Video

**Note:** Make sure to have the target video on the smartphone and that you have downloaded, installed, and signed in to the YouTube app before proceeding.

#### Step 1: Select a Video to Upload

On your Android or iOS smartphone, launch the YouTube app, tap the **+** (**Create**) icon from the bottom, tap **Create a Short** from the **Create** box that pops up from the bottom, tap **Upload** from the bottom-right corner of the next screen, and select and upload a short, 60 seconds video recorded in portrait orientation from your device’s storage to the app.

#### Step 2: Add Details

#### Step 3: Upload the Video

**Step 1:** Record Shorts Video

Previously, I have introduced [how to record and upload YouTube Shorts videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), so I will keep the content concise here.

Please note you will not see the **Create a Short** option if you are outsides of India.

In the YouTube app, tap the **+** (**Add**) button and select **Create** **a Short**. Please note you will not see the **Create a Short** option if you are outsides of India.

Quite recently, YouTube launched Shorts to compete with Tik Tok. At the time of this writing, the users in India have access to the fully functional version of the app. Although YouTube Shorts is available for both Android and iOS platforms, its functions are limited as the application is still in its Beta phase for the remaining part of the globe.

With that said, the following sections explain the step-by-step process on **how to upload a short video on YouTube** Shorts both from your smartphone and a PC.

## Part 1: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube from PC?

The fact is, if you are using a computer to upload short videos to YouTube, the process is identical to publishing your other, regular footage. However, there are a few guidelines that your clips must comply with so that the streaming platform could specifically identify them as YouTube Shorts. These norms include:

* Your videos must not be more than 60 seconds long in duration
* They must be shot in portrait orientation, ideally in the 9:16 aspect ratio
* The title or the description must contain ‘#Shorts’ (without quotes) in it

Once you have a video recorded using the first two guidelines from the above list, you can use the instructions given below to upload the media on YouTube:

#### Step 1: Select a Short Video to Upload

![Upload YouTube Shorts Video to desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-short-videos-on-youtube-pc.jpg)

Launch your favorite web browser on your PC, go to YouTube, make sure to sign in to your YouTube account, click the **Create** (**Camera**) icon from the top-right corner of the web page, click **SELECT FILES** on the **Upload videos** window, and locate, select, and upload a short video from your PC to the portal.

![Upload YouTube Shorts Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-short-videos-interface-on-youtube-pc.jpg)

#### Step 2: Mark the Video as Short

On the **Details** window that appears, add **#Shorts** in the **Title** or **Description** field, optionally pick a thumbnail from the suggested images present under the **Thumbnail** section (or upload a custom picture from your PC), select your preferred radio button from under the **Audience** section, make the other necessary changes if need be, and click **NEXT**. When the **Video elements** window comes up, choose your preferred options and elements, click **NEXT**.

![Mark YouTube Shorts Video in title and description](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mark-shorts-videos-on-youtube-pc.jpg)

#### Step 3: Publish the Short Video

On the **Visibility** window, choose your preferred radio button from under the **Save or publish** section or select **Schedule** to set a different time when the short video should be published automatically. Finally, click **SAVE** to publish the clip as a short video on YouTube from your computer.

![post YouTube Shorts Video  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/publish-youtube-shorts-video-desktop.jpg)

To sum up, uploading YouTube Shorts video from desktop has nothing different from uploading regular YouTube video besides the requirements listed at the beginning of this article.

## Part 2: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube Mobile App?

The process of **uploading YouTube Shorts** from the mobile app is fairly simple compared to the method used on a computer. While using the app, you can either upload an existing video or shoot a new one from within the program itself then and there, add music and text, and upload it right away. Both these methods are explained below in detail:

**Note:** The guidelines for creating and uploading short videos to YouTube remain the same, regardless of the platform or device you use.

### Method 1: Upload an Existing Short Video

**Note:** Make sure to have the target video on the smartphone and that you have downloaded, installed, and signed in to the YouTube app before proceeding.
