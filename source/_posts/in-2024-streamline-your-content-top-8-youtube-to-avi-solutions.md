## What is an AVI File?

Before we get into the full episode, let’s start by understanding the definition of .AVI file.

AVI stands for audio video interleave. An AVI is a video container format that capture, store and play audio- videos. The AVI file extensions are abbreviated as .avi.

It was developed by Microsoft in 1992 and works based on Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF). Its users enjoy built-in support in every Microsoft Windows application.

AVI encodes its audio and video data on codecs like XviD, DivX and MPEG-2\. A codec is a software or hardware used to compress or decompress digital video.

Before we get into the full episode, let’s start by understanding the definition of .AVI file.

AVI stands for audio video interleave. An AVI is a video container format that capture, store and play audio- videos. The AVI file extensions are abbreviated as .avi.

It was developed by Microsoft in 1992 and works based on Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF). Its users enjoy built-in support in every Microsoft Windows application.

AVI encodes its audio and video data on codecs like XviD, DivX and MPEG-2\. A codec is a software or hardware used to compress or decompress digital video.

Here are the tips;

* **Know your device features**\- This factor tops our list because it’s where all the actions will take place. Know its operating system, memory status, and screen resolution.
* **Choose a multi-functional YouTube to AVI converter**\- Don’t waste your device memory by downloading a YouTube video downloader that cannot convert the video to AVI.
* **Choose a converter that supports many file formats**\- YouTube supports a large number of file formats. To be able to select any video, the converting app should be able to convert the uploaded video.
* **Video resolution-** Compare the video resolution and those supported by the converting app. Some converters can only handle low bitrate videos.

Converting YouTube Videos to AVI is more simplified by the above-listed apps and software. But the biggest question is, can you upload AVI to YouTube? Check for the next article to learn more.
