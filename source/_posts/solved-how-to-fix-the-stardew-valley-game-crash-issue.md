System Requirements for Hyper Scape

 If your PC gear is good to go, check out the following fixes to get your game running perfectly again.

## Try these fixes

 Hyper Scape crashing can be caused by**faulty game files** ,**background apps** ,**outdated operating systems/drivers** , or**overclocking** , etc.

 No matter what the culprit is, try the following fixes that have worked for many players **if your Hyper Scape crashes to the desktop but Uplay works just fine** .

1. [Verify your game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Run Hyper Scape as administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Update your GPU driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Disable background apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Check for Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [Lower your graphics settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
7. [Turn on/off V-Sync](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
8. [Run your game in windowed mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
9. [Reinstall Uplay](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Verify your game files

 Missing game files can make your Hyper Scape unplayable, especially after a new update. Many Hyper Scape players managed to fix the crashing by verifying their game files. Here’s how to exactly do it:

1. In Uplay, click the**Games** tab at the top of the window
2. Hover over the game tile of your Hyper Scape. This will make a little arrow appear at the bottom right of the tile
3. Click on this arrow and click on**Verify files** from the drop-down menu.  
![Hyper Scape verify game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Verify-game-files.jpg)
4. It will take about 3-5 minutes to verify your game files. Once complete, try playing Hyper Scape again to test the issue.  

![verify your game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify-your-game-files.jpg)

 If it helps you restore some missing/corrupted game files, you can play the game without any crashing now. But if this fix doesn’t work, don’t worry, for there’re more fixes to try.

### Fix 2: Run Hyper Scape as an administrator

 Sometimes you may need to grant administrative rights to Hyper Scape to make sure your game has full rights to do anything it needs to do. Here’s how to run your game as an administrator permanently.

1. Go to the folder[where your game is installed](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-US/Faqs/000038997) .  
 Eg.**`C:Ubisoft Game LaunchergamesHyper Scape`**
2. Right-click**Hyperscape** executable file, and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Properties.jpg)
3. Go to the**Compatibility** tab, and check**Run this program as an administrator.** Then click**Apply > OK** to save the changes.  

![run Hyper Scape as admin](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/run-as-admin.jpg)
4. You can also run your game launcher i.e. Uplay as an administrator.

![run uplay as admin](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Run-Uplay-as-admin.jpg)
5. Try playing Hyper Scape again to see if the crashes persist.

 If you would like to grant administrative permissions only temporarily, right-click on the desktop icon of the game (or the executable file in the[installation directory](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-US/Faqs/000038997) ) and select**Run as Administrator** .

### Fix 3: Update your GPU drivers

 GPU drivers are vital to your gaming experience, and graphics companies keep releasing new drivers to fix bugs and improve game performance.

 Hyper Scape can crash randomly especially when your GPU driver is missing, corrupted, or out-of-date. Here’s how to update your graphics driver:

 You can update your drivers manually by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) , or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) ) to download the correct driver and install them manually.

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead,**do it automatically** with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now.jpg)
2. Click the**Update** button next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135405/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Or click**Update All** to update all of your drivers automatically (feel free to try the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , which comes with**Full Support** and a**30-day Money-Back Guarantee** . You will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
![update driver scan quickly](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Update-driver-3.jpg)
3. Restart your PC after the update is complete.

### Fix 6: Lower your graphics settings

 There’re a lot of customization options in Hyper Scape, but using the correct game settings can have a surprising impact on your game stability.

Best graphics settings for Hyper Scape

 If Hyper Scape keeps crashing even if you’ve lowered your graphics settings to very low, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 7: Turn on/off V-Sync

 Some users find enabling or disabling V-Sync helps fix the Hyper Scape crashing issue. If your V-Sync is left to**Off** , you can turn it on instead, and vice versa. Here’s how to do it:

1. Right-click your desktop, and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NVIDIA.jpg)
2. Go to**3D Settings > Manage 3D setting** on the left pane.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If you’ve turned V-Sync on, you can turn it to**Off** . This method has varying success, so you can move to the next fix if this doesn’t work.

### Fix 8: Switch to the windowed mode

 Many players find a windowed mode to fix their game crashing issues. When running your game, press**Alt + Enter** . If this keyboard shortcut doesn’t work, you can open the game’s graphics settings window and choose windowed mode instead.

 If this workaround doesn’t do the trick for you, you can switch out of windowed mode and re-enable full-screen mode afterward.

### Fix 9: Reinstall Uplay

 If game crashing is still bugging you, the last resort is to clean reinstall Uplay. This method works for many players.

1. Close the Uplay application.
2. You’d better[back up Uplay save games](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-US/faqs/000025801) before uninstalling.
3. Uninstall the Uplay client from your PC. By default, the uninstall application is located in`C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher` .
