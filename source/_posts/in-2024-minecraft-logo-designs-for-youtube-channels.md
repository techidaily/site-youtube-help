Gaming is the biggest genre on YouTube, and Minecraft resonates strongly with gamers of all ages. If you have a channel that features Minecraft content, and you want a banner that lets viewers know Minecraft is a focus of yours, then you’ve come to the right place!

There are a few sites where you can find Minecraft-themed channel art, and we’ve put together a list of the top 3.

> * [YouTube - Featured Channel: Netix](#netix)
> * [PlanetMinecraft Forums - Artists Section](#planetminecraft)
> * [Best Business Template](#bbt)

## Netix on YouTube

[Netix](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLW2fOeUEhu7kBvZwlOTZ4A/featured) posts Minecraft-themed graphics, and only Minecraft-themed graphics. You'll find a lot of high quality banners on this channel, and they're all free to download. Unlike a lot of creators who post one or two free banners, but mostly focus on other gaming content, Netix was at one point consistently posting new channel art (about once a month) for over a year.

Besides Netix, there are a lot of other artists posting gaming or Minecraft-themed banners on YouTube with download links. Just type 'minecraft youtube banner' into the search bar.

## Unveiling The Top 7 Android Apps to Banish Ads

Developers make money by including ADS in their applications. They have two alternatives for customers who want to use their apps: either pay for such a lifetime purchase of the app or enjoy the free version that includes ADS. Best ad blocker for android helps eliminate ADS from apps installed on our Android devices.

Many people choose to use the free version since they can't afford to pay for a standard app, while some opt for Mods, but the best method to avoid ADS is to use programs that block them entirely.
