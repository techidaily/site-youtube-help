**1\. Add filters & effects:** Adding filters and effects like Mosaic and Amaro can uplift your reversed video and make them attractive. Filmora has 200+ filters, utilities, overlays, and LUT.

**2\. Render/Perfect the audio:** Audio is the backbone of the video that provokes and makes the creation sound perfect and outstanding. 76 in-built audio tracks included in Filmora consisting of tender, sentimental, folk, rock, and young categories.

**3\. Transform your video with transitions:** While various ordinary videos crowd the Internet, make yours unique by transforming them with 3D effects and a slideshow. Filmora comes with 233 transitions like 3D, warp, dissolve & ripple slideshow, lifestyle, and still a lot more.

**4\. Perform video editing tricks:** While trim, cut & merge, crop & flip, resize, delete, and watermark are pre-defined and traditional editing tools, why don’t you try something new like creating freeze frames, accessing sample colors, and zoom in/out timeline where Filmora has a toolkit more than what you expect.
