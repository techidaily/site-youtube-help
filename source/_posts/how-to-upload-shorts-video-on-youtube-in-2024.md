## Part 1: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube from PC?

The fact is, if you are using a computer to upload short videos to YouTube, the process is identical to publishing your other, regular footage. However, there are a few guidelines that your clips must comply with so that the streaming platform could specifically identify them as YouTube Shorts. These norms include:

* Your videos must not be more than 60 seconds long in duration
* They must be shot in portrait orientation, ideally in the 9:16 aspect ratio
* The title or the description must contain â€˜#Shortsâ€™ (without quotes) in it

Once you have a video recorded using the first two guidelines from the above list, you can use the instructions given below to upload the media on YouTube:

#### Step 1: Select a Short Video to Upload

Quite recently, YouTube launched Shorts to compete with Tik Tok. At the time of this writing, the users in India have access to the fully functional version of the app. Although YouTube Shorts is available for both Android and iOS platforms, its functions are limited as the application is still in its Beta phase for the remaining part of the globe.

With that said, the following sections explain the step-by-step process on **how to upload a short video on YouTube** Shorts both from your smartphone and a PC.

## Part 1: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube from PC?

The fact is, if you are using a computer to upload short videos to YouTube, the process is identical to publishing your other, regular footage. However, there are a few guidelines that your clips must comply with so that the streaming platform could specifically identify them as YouTube Shorts. These norms include:

* Your videos must not be more than 60 seconds long in duration
* They must be shot in portrait orientation, ideally in the 9:16 aspect ratio
* The title or the description must contain â€˜#Shortsâ€™ (without quotes) in it

Once you have a video recorded using the first two guidelines from the above list, you can use the instructions given below to upload the media on YouTube:

#### Step 1: Select a Short Video to Upload

When the **Video elements** window comes up, choose your preferred options and elements, click **NEXT**.

## Part 2: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube Mobile App?

The process of **uploading YouTube Shorts** from the mobile app is fairly simple compared to the method used on a computer. While using the app, you can either upload an existing video or shoot a new one from within the program itself then and there, add music and text, and upload it right away. Both these methods are explained below in detail:

**Note:** The guidelines for creating and uploading short videos to YouTube remain the same, regardless of the platform or device you use.

### Method 1: Upload an Existing Short Video

**Note:** Make sure to have the target video on the smartphone and that you have downloaded, installed, and signed in to the YouTube app before proceeding.

#### Step 1: Select a Video to Upload

![Select a Video to Upload as Shorts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-shorts-videos-to-upload-on-youtube.jpg)

On your Android or iOS smartphone, launch the YouTube app, tap the **+** (**Create**) icon from the bottom, tap **Create a Short** from the **Create** box that pops up from the bottom, tap **Upload** from the bottom-right corner of the next screen, and select and upload a short, 60 seconds video recorded in portrait orientation from your deviceâ€™s storage to the app.

#### Step 2: Add Details

![add details to Shorts video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-details-to-youtube-shrots-video.jpg)

On the next screen, tap **NEXT**, user the **Music** and **Text** icons at the bottom-left corner to add a background music and caption to the video respectively, and tap **NEXT** from the top-right corner. On the next screen, enter a name for the video in the **Title** field along with the **#Shorts** tag, and tap **Select audience** to choose your preferred audience.

#### Step 3: Upload the Video

Finally tap **UPLOAD** from the top-right corner to upload the short video on YouTube.

### Method 2: Record a Short Video and Upload

**Step 1:** Record Shorts Video

Previously, I have introduced [how to record and upload YouTube Shorts videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), so I will keep the content concise here.

Please note you will not see the **Create a Short** option if you are outsides of India.

![ Record YouTube Shorts video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-create-youtube-short-video-mobile.jpg)

In the YouTube app, tap the **+** (**Add**) button and select **Create** **a Short**. Please note you will not see the **Create a Short** option if you are outsides of India.

Next, use the **Speed** and **Timer** icons to set the speed of the video and the countdown timer duration before the app starts recording the video when you press the **Record** button respectively.

Now tap the **Record** button from the bottom to start recording a video and stop to stop the recording. Make sure to shoot the footage in the portrait mode (ideally in the 9:16 aspect ratio). Tap **NEXT** from the bottom-right corner to proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Add Text and Music to the Short Video**

On the next window, use the **Music** and **Text** buttons from the bottom-left corner to add a background music and caption to the video, and tap **NEXT** from the top-right corner.

**Step 3:** **Upload and Post the Short Video**

On the **Add details** window, enter a name for the video along with the **#Shorts** tag in the **Create a title** field, tap **Select audience** to select the target audience, and tap **UPLOAD** from the top-right corner to upload the short video on YouTube.

**Conclusion**

Learning the process of **how to post short videos on YouTube** is fairly simple as long as you have the video recorded in the portrait orientation, it is up to 60 seconds long, and contains the â€˜#Shortsâ€™ tag (without quotes) in the title or description. The good thing is, if you donâ€™t have access to the YouTube app on your smartphone, the method for **how to upload short video on YouTube** explained in the first section can be followed while using your desktop computer.

## Part 1\. What you need to know about YouTube Monetization

### Rules and requirements for YouTube Monetization

YouTube Monetization means making money from YouTube content. For monetization, you need to join the YouTube Partner program and for this, you need to follow some requirements. In order to benefit from YPP fan funding, such as Super Chats and Super Thanks, here are the minimum requirements:

* A subscriber base of 500
* 90-day history of public uploads
