### Frequently Asked Questions About Embedding YouTube Videos in PowerPoint

#### 2\. Why Can’t I Embed YouTube Videos in PowerPoint for Mac?

You can insert YouTube videos only in Office 365 and Office 2019 versions for Mac.

However, if it is PowerPoint 2011 for Mac that you are using, you can’t insert YouTube video to it, and you need to upgrade your MS Office to a higher version for that purpose.

#### 3\. Why Can’t I Embed a YouTube Video in PowerPoint 2013?

The version of PowerPoint 2013 that was released initially didn’t allow YouTube video embedding. However, with an update **4018374** that Microsoft rolled out in August 2018, the feature got enabled. You can download and install the update from <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4018374/august-7-2018-update-for-powerpoint-2013-kb4018374> link, and then try inserting a YouTube video to your version of PowerPoint.

#### 4\. How Do I Embed a YouTube Video in PowerPoint without Being Online?

YouTube videos that you embed to your PowerPoint presentations can’t be played in offline mode. However, there is a workaround to this. You can download the video from YouTube to your computer using any YouTube downloader, and then use the process explained in **Method 4** to insert the clip from your PC.

**Conclusion**

Although the above sections explain **how to embed a YouTube video in PowerPoint**, the process to do so may vary in different versions of Microsoft Office. Also, depending on what edition of the program you are using, embedding YouTube videos may or may not be supported according to the availability of the add-ins or updates that Microsoft has rolled out for that particular built of the app.

#### 3\. Why Can’t I Embed a YouTube Video in PowerPoint 2013?

The version of PowerPoint 2013 that was released initially didn’t allow YouTube video embedding. However, with an update **4018374** that Microsoft rolled out in August 2018, the feature got enabled. You can download and install the update from <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4018374/august-7-2018-update-for-powerpoint-2013-kb4018374> link, and then try inserting a YouTube video to your version of PowerPoint.

#### 4\. How Do I Embed a YouTube Video in PowerPoint without Being Online?

YouTube videos that you embed to your PowerPoint presentations can’t be played in offline mode. However, there is a workaround to this. You can download the video from YouTube to your computer using any YouTube downloader, and then use the process explained in **Method 4** to insert the clip from your PC.

**Conclusion**

Although the above sections explain **how to embed a YouTube video in PowerPoint**, the process to do so may vary in different versions of Microsoft Office. Also, depending on what edition of the program you are using, embedding YouTube videos may or may not be supported according to the availability of the add-ins or updates that Microsoft has rolled out for that particular built of the app.
