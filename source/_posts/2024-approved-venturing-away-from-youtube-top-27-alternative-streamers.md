## What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?

When it first started in 2017, YouTube TV was limited to a small number of areas in the United States. That changed in 2019 when a significant expansion included support for all 210 markets.

There are currently over 85 stations available on YouTube TV, including four major national broadcasters: ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox.

Nonetheless, YouTube TV is not the same as YouTube, and you'll need two apps on your streaming device to access both.
