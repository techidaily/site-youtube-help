## **Part 3: Block content on YouTube kids**

 YouTube Kids is the alternative version of YouTube’s video service dedicated and designed for kids. It’s entirely for children with all the content curated for kids’ education, family-friendly videos, and channels surrounding kid’s liking. The interface features colorful large images, and icons with five categories to explore from.

 The app filters all the content allowing only safe content and parental control to watch their children’s online activity. The app prevents commenting and any kind of cyber bullying-related issues. YouTube Kids need to be set up by an adult with singing into the app with their Google credentials. Parents can sign in and block channels or videos they don’t see fit for their children. Let us see how to block YouTube channels on YouTube kids.

* 1\. Open the YouTube Kids app and tap on **I’m a parent** to set up the app.

The Photos app on your iPhone offers a range of features that you can use to create a custom thumbnail for your YouTube video. Here are some of the features you can use:

* **Crop:** The crop tool allows you to resize and reposition your thumbnail image by trimming away any unnecessary parts of the image.
* **Rotate:** The rotate tool lets you adjust the orientation of your thumbnail image. You can rotate the image clockwise or counterclockwise to achieve the desired angle.
* **Adjust lighting and color:** The lighting and color tools allow you to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, and other aspects of the thumbnail image to enhance its overall appearance.
* **Add text:** You can use the text tool to add words or phrases to your thumbnail image. This can be a great way to include a call-to-action or to highlight a key feature of your video.
* **Add filters and stickers:** The Photos app includes a range of filters and stickers that you can use to give your thumbnail image a unique look. You can experiment with filters and stickers to find the perfect one for your thumbnail.

To create a thumbnail using the Photos app on your iPhone, follow these steps:

Step1 Open the Photos app and find the image you want to use as your thumbnail. **Tap** on the image to open it.

PixelLab is a powerful graphic design app with many features and tools for creating custom thumbnails. With PixelLab, you can add text, shapes, and stickers to your thumbnail image and adjust the image's color, lighting, and other aspects to get the perfect look.
