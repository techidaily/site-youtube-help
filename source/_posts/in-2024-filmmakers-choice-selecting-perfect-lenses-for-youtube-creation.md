The staple of any vlog is the talking headshot, a shot of the speaker talking directly to the audience. You can compose this shot with different kinds of lenses for your interchangeable lens camera.

But which kind of lens is the right lens for you as a vlogger?

In this article, I’m going to help you figure that out.

* [Part 7: Optical Image Stabilization](#OpticalImageStabilization)

### Three Focal Length Groups: Wide, Standard, Telephoto

There are three main ranges in focal lengths that camera lenses can be categorized into wide, standard, and telephoto.

#### Wide-Angle Lens

Wide-angle lenses can “see more.” They allow more of your scene to fit inside your frame. Objects that are closer to the lens appear much bigger while objects that are further away appear even smaller. Perspectives are also enhanced, making close objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame appear more stretched out. Out of all the other ranges in focal lengths, wide-angle lenses will appear the least zoomed in.

#### Standard Lens

With standard lenses or normal lenses, you won’t get the stretched out objects or enhanced perspectives that you get from wide-angle lenses. Instead, standard lenses are meant to see scenes as the natural human eye is meant to see them. If you shoot a scene with both a wide-angle lens and a standard lens from the same position, you’ll notice that less of the scene fits into your frame. Standard lenses will appear more zoomed-in than wide-angle lenses, but less zoomed-in than telephoto lenses.

#### Telephoto Lens

Out of all the other ranges in focal lengths, telephoto lenses will appear the most zoomed in. This can be beneficial for the shooter who wants to get a closer shot of a scene without having to physically be in close proximity to the scene. Objects that are further away in the background also appear larger and closer than they would appear on wide-angle or standard lenses.

### Vlogging With Each Focal Length Group

You can get your talking head footage using lenses from any of the three focal length groups. Depending on how you plan to vlog most of the time, though, one of the three focal lengths might be more suitable for you.

#### When to vlog with a wide-angle lens

Wide-angle lenses are the most commonly used lenses for vlogging. Wide-angle lenses are great when you need to be close to your camera. This might be the case for you if your recording space is small or if you want to film yourself as you hold your camera up with your own hand.

Being close to your camera not only gives you the option to use your camera’s built-in microphone, but it also gives you the option to make use of camera-mounted shotgun microphones.

#### When to vlog with a standard lens

Standard lenses are great when you have more space to be further away from your camera. The perspectives in your shot will look more natural through a standard lens, making your talking head footage feel more corporate or professional. You’ll also be able to get blurrier backgrounds using a standard lens versus a wide-angle lens.

Being further away from your camera, however, means that you’ll have to use a separate microphone positioned closer to you.

#### When to vlog with a telephoto lens

As telephoto lenses are even more zoomed in, you’ll need to be even further away from your camera to fit yourself inside your camera frame. Why would any vlogger ever need to be that far away from their camera? One word… teleprompter. If you want or need to stick to a script, you’ll have to be far away enough from your camera that it doesn’t appear like your eyes are scanning left to right. You then close in the distance with a telephoto lens.

  In the above video, Marcos Rocha compares different focal lengths for talking head videos. Which focal length range do you like the look of?

### Crop Factor

Focal lengths in camera lenses are measured in millimeters. You can vlog yourself handheld with a 24mm lens on a camera with a full-frame sensor (the sensor is the piece of hardware inside your camera that turns the light it receives into a digital image). But if you use a 24mm lens on a camera with a smaller sensor, like an APS-C sensor or even smaller Micro 4/3 sensor, more of you will get cropped out (see below).

 ![Crop Factor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-crop-factor.jpg)

 In order to make up for the cropping that occurs, you will need to use a wider lens on cameras with smaller sensors to get the same shot you’d get with a full-frame camera.

### Focal Length Equivalency Table

This table shows you the focal lengths needed to achieve the same shot between cameras with different sensor sizes. In order to take a shot as wide as the shot I took of myself with the 24mm lens on my full-frame camera, I would need a 15mm lens on an APS-C sensor camera or a 12mm lens on a micro 4/3 camera.

| Focal Length / Sensor       | Full Frame | APS-C | Micro 4/3 |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ----- | --------- |
| Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe) | 16mm       | 10mm  | 8mm       |
| Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe) | 18mm       | 11mm  | 9mm       |
| Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe) | 24mm       | 15mm  | 12mm      |
| Wide                        | 35mm       | 22mm  | 18mm      |
| Standard                    | 50mm       | 31mm  | 25mm      |
| Telephoto                   | 70mm       | 44mm  | 35mm      |
| Telephoto                   | 100mm      | 63mm  | 50mm      |
| Telephoto                   | 200mm      | 125mm | 100mm     |

### Aperture

 ![Camera lenses Aperture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-aperture.jpg)

 The next thing to consider when you’re looking for a lens is the aperture, the hole (often adjustable) within the lens that lets light in. Aperture for camera lenses is measured in f-stops (f/1.4, f/1.8, f/2.0) - the smaller the f-stop number, the larger the aperture (bigger hole letting even more light in).

 ![Camera lenses Aperture Range](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-aperture-range.png)

 Because larger aperture lenses let more light in, they need a shorter time for cameras to compose an image. This is why larger aperture lenses are also called “fast” lenses.

Fast lenses are more expensive because they cost more to produce. There’s a lot more that goes into them, including larger and higher quality glass elements.

But do you even need a fast lens?

### Vlogging With a Fast Lens

#### Pros of Vlogging With a Fast Lens

* Better low-light performance
* Better autofocus performance
* Better "bokeh" (out-of-focus areas, like your background, having that nice blurry look that you see in a lot of movies)

#### Cons of Vlogging With a Fast Lens

* More expensive
* Moving subjects more likely to get out of focus when shooting with a large aperture
* Better continuous autofocus performance needed when shooting moving subjects with a large aperture

### Optical Image Stabilization

Finally, you’ll have to decide whether or not you want your lens to have built-in optical image stabilization (OIS).

OIS is very beneficial to have on a lens if you’re a vlogger who films mostly handheld footage. Although this technology adds to the price of your lens as well, it can greatly help you to capture smoother footage that may otherwise be shaky. Nikon calls this technology “Vibration Reduction” (VR) for their lenses.

  In the above video, you can see how much OIS can help to stabilize your footage. MicBergsma simultaneously compares the footage between two GoPro Hero5 Blacks, one with OIS on and one with OIS off.

If, however, you are shooting most of your vlogs on a tripod, you won’t need a lens with OIS.

Wide-angle lenses are the most commonly used lenses for vlogging. Wide-angle lenses are great when you need to be close to your camera. This might be the case for you if your recording space is small or if you want to film yourself as you hold your camera up with your own hand.

Being close to your camera not only gives you the option to use your camera’s built-in microphone, but it also gives you the option to make use of camera-mounted shotgun microphones.

#### When to vlog with a standard lens

Standard lenses are great when you have more space to be further away from your camera. The perspectives in your shot will look more natural through a standard lens, making your talking head footage feel more corporate or professional. You’ll also be able to get blurrier backgrounds using a standard lens versus a wide-angle lens.

Being further away from your camera, however, means that you’ll have to use a separate microphone positioned closer to you.

#### When to vlog with a telephoto lens

As telephoto lenses are even more zoomed in, you’ll need to be even further away from your camera to fit yourself inside your camera frame. Why would any vlogger ever need to be that far away from their camera? One word… teleprompter. If you want or need to stick to a script, you’ll have to be far away enough from your camera that it doesn’t appear like your eyes are scanning left to right. You then close in the distance with a telephoto lens.

  In the above video, Marcos Rocha compares different focal lengths for talking head videos. Which focal length range do you like the look of?

### Crop Factor

Focal lengths in camera lenses are measured in millimeters. You can vlog yourself handheld with a 24mm lens on a camera with a full-frame sensor (the sensor is the piece of hardware inside your camera that turns the light it receives into a digital image). But if you use a 24mm lens on a camera with a smaller sensor, like an APS-C sensor or even smaller Micro 4/3 sensor, more of you will get cropped out (see below).

 ![Crop Factor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-crop-factor.jpg)

 In order to make up for the cropping that occurs, you will need to use a wider lens on cameras with smaller sensors to get the same shot you’d get with a full-frame camera.

### Focal Length Equivalency Table

This table shows you the focal lengths needed to achieve the same shot between cameras with different sensor sizes. In order to take a shot as wide as the shot I took of myself with the 24mm lens on my full-frame camera, I would need a 15mm lens on an APS-C sensor camera or a 12mm lens on a micro 4/3 camera.

| Focal Length / Sensor       | Full Frame | APS-C | Micro 4/3 |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ----- | --------- |
| Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe) | 16mm       | 10mm  | 8mm       |
| Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe) | 18mm       | 11mm  | 9mm       |
| Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe) | 24mm       | 15mm  | 12mm      |
| Wide                        | 35mm       | 22mm  | 18mm      |
| Standard                    | 50mm       | 31mm  | 25mm      |
| Telephoto                   | 70mm       | 44mm  | 35mm      |
| Telephoto                   | 100mm      | 63mm  | 50mm      |
| Telephoto                   | 200mm      | 125mm | 100mm     |

### Aperture

 ![Camera lenses Aperture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-aperture.jpg)

 The next thing to consider when you’re looking for a lens is the aperture, the hole (often adjustable) within the lens that lets light in. Aperture for camera lenses is measured in f-stops (f/1.4, f/1.8, f/2.0) - the smaller the f-stop number, the larger the aperture (bigger hole letting even more light in).

 ![Camera lenses Aperture Range](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-aperture-range.png)

 Because larger aperture lenses let more light in, they need a shorter time for cameras to compose an image. This is why larger aperture lenses are also called “fast” lenses.

Fast lenses are more expensive because they cost more to produce. There’s a lot more that goes into them, including larger and higher quality glass elements.

But do you even need a fast lens?

### Vlogging With a Fast Lens

#### Pros of Vlogging With a Fast Lens

* Better low-light performance
* Better autofocus performance
* Better "bokeh" (out-of-focus areas, like your background, having that nice blurry look that you see in a lot of movies)

#### Cons of Vlogging With a Fast Lens

* More expensive
* Moving subjects more likely to get out of focus when shooting with a large aperture
* Better continuous autofocus performance needed when shooting moving subjects with a large aperture

### Optical Image Stabilization

Finally, you’ll have to decide whether or not you want your lens to have built-in optical image stabilization (OIS).

OIS is very beneficial to have on a lens if you’re a vlogger who films mostly handheld footage. Although this technology adds to the price of your lens as well, it can greatly help you to capture smoother footage that may otherwise be shaky. Nikon calls this technology “Vibration Reduction” (VR) for their lenses.

  In the above video, you can see how much OIS can help to stabilize your footage. MicBergsma simultaneously compares the footage between two GoPro Hero5 Blacks, one with OIS on and one with OIS off.

If, however, you are shooting most of your vlogs on a tripod, you won’t need a lens with OIS.

## Mastering Video Dimensions: The Key to YouTube Presence

Yes, you are right. Social media is the platform that no one can refrain from in the current world of technology, news, events, and friends. One such platform gained so much popularity in the last few years. That is YouTube, a platform that is used worldwide for a multitude of purposes. Such as watching videos, uploading or sharing videos, tutorials, trends, series, coaching, serials, shorts videos, news, events, displaying ads, and lots more. No doubt, the list is endless.

Well, while dealing with YouTube videos, there is one most crucial point to keep in mind. If you have a vision or some thought, you can create a new genre of video under YouTube. And that is the YouTube Aspect Ratio, to have the best visual experience for the users worldwide.

![youtube platform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-platform.jpg)

Aspect ratio is simply the width to the height ratio for the screen. But it holds great value to create a difference while displaying YouTube Shorts Videos with proper ratio and size as it is only then that it will get proper attention and get trends.

04 [Think More about YouTube Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos

YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:

![youtube aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-aspect-ratio.jpg)

**Note:** YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar's white or grey/black area along the edges.

**●** YouTube Aspect Ratio for Desktop/PC Version:

If you are a desktop, PC, or laptop user, the standard YouTube Aspect ratio is 16:9, which is for landscape view. In the case of vertical video with a YouTube Aspect Ratio of 9:16, YouTube will make some adjustments by providing padding to the corner of the video. (That is not the right way for the optimum view as it may result in interfering with the dynamic vision of the YouTube Video.)

**●** YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for Android devices:

There is an interesting fact about the YouTube Video Ratio for Android devices. Actually, in the case of Android mobile devices, the YouTube app will make an auto adjustment to the video file size and set the video as per the screen space.

**●** YouTube Video Ratio for iOS Version

Like Android phones, iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad, YouTube App player will also automatically adjust the Video file size to fit the screen. It does not matter whether the video is in Square, horizontal or vertical format; it will auto-adjust the aspect ratio.

Let’s take the example of Vertical Video display in YouTube Screen:

![vertical video example](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/vertical-video-example.jpg)

Also, by selecting the Expand option, the video will adjust itself to fill the entire screen.

## Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio

The world is moving swiftly, and with day passing, people want to complete their tasks as quickly as possible. The impact is seen in the field of the YouTube Video making process also with the introduction of YouTube Shorts. After following the short video trends of TikTok, this time YouTube appeared with its new feature YouTube Shorts, which allows a user to create a short video that ranges from 15 to 60 seconds. The only need is for a Smartphone and YouTube Application Shorts camera. And then you are good to go. Note that YouTube Shorts videos get searched and watched by people mainly through their phones.

![youtube shorts ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-shorts-ratio.jpg)

Here also comes the concept of YouTube Shorts Ratio as YouTube Videos primarily follows Vertical format. Following are the requirement for YouTube Shorts Ratio:

**Aspect Ratio:** Vertical format standard ratio is 9:16 (That fill up the entire screen vertically)

**Resolution:** To comply with vertical format, the required resolution is 1920X1080 px.

**Note:** There is also provision for square videos with a 1:1 ratio for YouTube Shorts. But that results in extra white or black padding at the top and bottom areas.

Other possible YouTube Shorts ratios are 4:5, 2:3, 1:2.

## Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads

If you want to monetize from your video or Shorts, use YouTube Ads to generate additional income. Or, if you are already in some business and want to grow your business, do it with YouTube Ads.

![youtube-ads-aspect-ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-ads-aspect-ratio.jpg)

Now, you might be wondering, what would be the possible YouTube Outro size or YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for YouTube Ads? Check here:

YouTube Video Aspect ratio and Proportions: 19:9 (640X360), 4:3 (480X360)

Aspect Ratio for Desktop Ads: 16:9
