After signing in to your Canva account, click **Create a design** from the top-right corner of the page, click **Custom size** from the bottom, define **1280** and **720** in the **Width** and **Height** fields on the box that appears respectively, and click **Create new design**.

To add a **YouTube thumbnail border**, make sure that the image that you added to the Canvas is selected, click the **Duplicate** icon from the upper-right area, and use the scaling handles of the copy of the image to increase its size a bit.

**Summary**

It is important to know that the default resolution of a YouTube thumbnail is 1280 x 720 pixels that is usually written and referred to as 720p. While adding a **YouTube thumbnail border**, it is also imperative to have a good sense of color combination and fonts. Furthermore, a decent tool like Wondershare Filmora X must be used to add an appealing **neon border** around the main subject in the thumbnail image easily and quickly.
