Also while naming makes sure to check is that any similar to what you have a planner or not. If you don’t find any similar channels you are really good to go.

#### 3\. Make it Catchy

Your channel name should be such extra making people remember easily. So if the channel name is unique, more it will be in people’s minds too.

#### 4\. Avoid numbers

Adding numbers to your YouTube channel would make it difficult for viewers to remember it. Numbers also don’t go easy for searching for a name too and it gets harder.

If you are still not clear and confused you can take the help of a few of the best name generators available online. You just need to write one word or phrase and get a range of naming ideas in front of you
