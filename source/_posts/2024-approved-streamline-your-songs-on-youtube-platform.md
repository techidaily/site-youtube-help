If you want to use copyrighted music on YouTube lawfully, you'll need to go out and seek permission from the original creator. The second side of music licensing is this. Copyright law ensures that creators are compensated when their work is used, and this is where YouTube's music policy comes into play.

## How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?

At the end of the day, YouTube is a video-sharing site. Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn't commonplace, including a video can't hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you're working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.

The songs in YouTube's library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora's library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.

Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.

Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here's a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.

This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It's also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn't the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.

**Step 1:** The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio

Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to 'MEDIA' and then to the 'IMPORT' option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select 'Import Media Files' from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.

**Step 2:** Adding music to a timeline

Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the '+' sign ('Add to Project' will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.

**Step 3:** Make changes to the music file

By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.

**Step 4:** Export your work

After you've made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the 'EXPORT' tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.

#### Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?

YouTube's music library is relatively small. The songs include both traditional public domain and generic royalty-free music. Your selections will be limited if you're adding (or replacing) music directly from YouTube. This is why pre-editing your videos is the most pleasing thing you can do for them. This will enable you to add bespoke music from services.

## Conclusion

‚óè We hope you now have a better concept of how to post your song to YouTube if you've ever wondered. On the surface, posting songs to YouTube may appear complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it'll be a snap. When considering how to promote your music, YouTube should not be disregarded. It's rare to have a free platform to distribute music on, so make use of it. With such a massive YouTube user base, your potential audience is enormous. Get your song on the platform and promote it as much as possible. You never know who might come upon your tunes until you've made them public. This concluded the tutorial on how to upload music to YouTube.

## What's the best YouTube video size for you?

 It is recommended by professionals to use the YouTube video dimensions 1080p, or 1920 x 1080.

 These ones are the ideal because it will not only facilitate the video with a professional and elite look but also consumes relatively much less data. Moreover, if you use a phone for recording your videos then using the quality higher than the ones mentioned above will cost you with ample memory.

 If you are a newbie to the world of YouTube and want to up the device's storage game then 720p would still do wonders.

## What is the video aspect ratio?

 This term refers to the proportion of your video. In other words, the video aspect ratio can be defined as the width or breadth (of an image or screen) with respect to its height. Such a ratio can be expressed or represented in the form of "width x height.

 That means an aspect ratio of 4x3 refers to an image that is 4 unit wide and 3 units high. Similarly, it can also be expressed with a colon in between the units such as 4:3 or 16:9.

 The aspect ratio of a video merely refers to the relationship among the width and height respectively and not the actual physical size of the image.

 The most common aspect ratios used in the video are depicted below for sound understanding:

![dimensions of a youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-aspect-ratios.jpg)

 Image from learn.g2

 The aspect ratio is the proportion of your video. This image displays the three most common aspect ratios.

 Aspect ratio refers to the ratio of height and width although dimensions refer to two separate measurements of height and width rather than a ratio with "pixel" as its unit.

## Standard aspect ratios

 Below are the most common aspect ratios used for the video. There may be certain amendments to the ones mentioned below but the following formats are used mostly by the film and video makers.

 Let's review the quick breakdown of the available aspect ratio options that you can opt accordingly:

| Aspect ratio | Application                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1:1 or 1x1   | This aspect ratio will mostly be seen in the Instagram video. This 1:1 ratio gives a video a perfect square shape.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4:3 or 4x3   | This aspect ratio was mostly seen few ages ago in almost the amidst 20th century on the TV. This was used to be a standard television format back then. So if you are a 90's kid or an adult then you must be familiar with this format while watching your favorite old schooled sitcoms! |
| 16:9 or 16x9 | The format was enhanced to 16:9 aspect ratio for more HD quality and better viewing experience. This format is widely being used in televisions, theatres, DVD or high definition professional videos.                                                                                     |
| 21:9 or 21x9 | For more than merely an HD video quality and astonishing user experience, the formats have been upgraded to 21:9 aspect ratio. This is dominantly being used in the cinema for movie theatre releases.                                                                                     |

## The right aspect ratio for YouTube videos

 YouTube recommends using an aspect ratio of **16:9**  according to the video player that YouTube uses. You are also given an option to upload your videos vertically but this will amend the aspect ratio respectively.

 When you upload a video with an aspect ratio other than the one mention formerly then YouTube will automatically place the black bars on the sides. This is done to display the best quality video with the right resolution otherwise it will be displayed as distorted or cropped.

 A vertical ratio with may be 4:3 video aspect ratio will be displayed like the image given below:

### 2\. Perfect size for your YouTube thumbnail photo

#### What is YouTube thumbnail?

 A thumbnail photo is the picture of one of the frames of your video that you select to let the viewers see the quick glace or snapshot of your video while they browse YouTube.

 You can choose any of the snapshots, technically known as a thumbnail, right after uploading your video on your channel. Either you can let YouTube choose any thumbnail or you choose your own.

#### Why is it important?

 Choosing the appropriate thumbnail is one of the most important factors you cannot neglect. In order to gain views the most on your videos, a wise selection of a perfect YouTube video thumbnail dimensions will attract the viewers. Hence this will can uplift your views to a drastic extent.

#### A quick tip for the perfect YouTube thumbnail

 Take a look at the popular you tubers and see what strategies they use when uploading their thumbnails. Usually, the video content is not as appealing as the thumbnail itself. That's what you need to understand! Just see by yourself how large text and striking images will do wonders!

#### YouTube video thumbnail dimension for a perfect thumbnail image

 The preferred YouTube screen size of your thumbnail image is 1280 x 720 pixels.

 Similar to the YouTube video, the aspect ratio of your thumbnail is 16:9.

 For even more clear understanding, look into this illustration:

 Image from learn.g2

### 3\. Perfect size for your YouTube banner

 YouTube offers two main areas for image display of your channel. One is an icon image while other is what YouTube calls "Channel Art". This is the same as Facebook's cover photo. People often call it "YouTube banner". It is a header image displayed at the top of your channel.

![youtube video size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-banner-size.jpg)

 For each kind of display (mobile, desktop, and TV), channel art (or banner) dimension changes accordingly.

 Either your cover photo or your YouTube banner is displayed at the top of the channel so it's highly significant to consider what you are depicting about your channel through these images.

 Hence, this being said or realized, selecting the appropriate banner resolution should be among your topmost priorities.

 The recommended banner dimensions of a YouTube video as suggested by YouTube are 2560 x 1440 pixels. But the dimensions may slightly vary with the variation in the devices being used by the users.

| Displays        | Banner image Dimensions |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Video display   | 2560 x 1440 pixels      |
| Desktop display | 2560 x 423 pixels       |
| Tablet display  | 1855 x 423 pixels       |
| Television      | 2560 x 1440 pixels      |

 For a thorough understanding, refer to the image below:

## What's the best YouTube video size for you?

 It is recommended by professionals to use the YouTube video dimensions 1080p, or 1920 x 1080.

 These ones are the ideal because it will not only facilitate the video with a professional and elite look but also consumes relatively much less data. Moreover, if you use a phone for recording your videos then using the quality higher than the ones mentioned above will cost you with ample memory.

## What is the video aspect ratio?

 This term refers to the proportion of your video. In other words, the video aspect ratio can be defined as the width or breadth (of an image or screen) with respect to its height. Such a ratio can be expressed or represented in the form of "width x height.

 That means an aspect ratio of 4x3 refers to an image that is 4 unit wide and 3 units high. Similarly, it can also be expressed with a colon in between the units such as 4:3 or 16:9.

 The aspect ratio of a video merely refers to the relationship among the width and height respectively and not the actual physical size of the image.

## What's the best YouTube video size for you?

 It is recommended by professionals to use the YouTube video dimensions 1080p, or 1920 x 1080.

 These ones are the ideal because it will not only facilitate the video with a professional and elite look but also consumes relatively much less data. Moreover, if you use a phone for recording your videos then using the quality higher than the ones mentioned above will cost you with ample memory.

 If you are a newbie to the world of YouTube and want to up the device's storage game then 720p would still do wonders.

## What is the video aspect ratio?

 This term refers to the proportion of your video. In other words, the video aspect ratio can be defined as the width or breadth (of an image or screen) with respect to its height. Such a ratio can be expressed or represented in the form of "width x height.

 That means an aspect ratio of 4x3 refers to an image that is 4 unit wide and 3 units high. Similarly, it can also be expressed with a colon in between the units such as 4:3 or 16:9.

 The aspect ratio of a video merely refers to the relationship among the width and height respectively and not the actual physical size of the image.

 The most common aspect ratios used in the video are depicted below for sound understanding:

![dimensions of a youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-aspect-ratios.jpg)

 Image from learn.g2

 The aspect ratio is the proportion of your video. This image displays the three most common aspect ratios.

 Aspect ratio refers to the ratio of height and width although dimensions refer to two separate measurements of height and width rather than a ratio with "pixel" as its unit.

## Standard aspect ratios

 Below are the most common aspect ratios used for the video. There may be certain amendments to the ones mentioned below but the following formats are used mostly by the film and video makers.

 Let's review the quick breakdown of the available aspect ratio options that you can opt accordingly:

| Aspect ratio | Application                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1:1 or 1x1   | This aspect ratio will mostly be seen in the Instagram video. This 1:1 ratio gives a video a perfect square shape.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4:3 or 4x3   | This aspect ratio was mostly seen few ages ago in almost the amidst 20th century on the TV. This was used to be a standard television format back then. So if you are a 90's kid or an adult then you must be familiar with this format while watching your favorite old schooled sitcoms! |
| 16:9 or 16x9 | The format was enhanced to 16:9 aspect ratio for more HD quality and better viewing experience. This format is widely being used in televisions, theatres, DVD or high definition professional videos.                                                                                     |
| 21:9 or 21x9 | For more than merely an HD video quality and astonishing user experience, the formats have been upgraded to 21:9 aspect ratio. This is dominantly being used in the cinema for movie theatre releases.                                                                                     |

## The right aspect ratio for YouTube videos

 YouTube recommends using an aspect ratio of **16:9**  according to the video player that YouTube uses. You are also given an option to upload your videos vertically but this will amend the aspect ratio respectively.

 When you upload a video with an aspect ratio other than the one mention formerly then YouTube will automatically place the black bars on the sides. This is done to display the best quality video with the right resolution otherwise it will be displayed as distorted or cropped.

 A vertical ratio with may be 4:3 video aspect ratio will be displayed like the image given below:
