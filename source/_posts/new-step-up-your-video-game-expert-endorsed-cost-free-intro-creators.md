An intro video goes a long way towards building your brand and showing viewers that you’re serious about YouTube. Here’s where you can make or download intros, plus some tips on making intros that support the growth of your channel.

1. [4 Free Intro Makers](#makers)
2. [5 Tips for Making Great Intros](#tips)

## Free Intro Makers

Here’s a list of 4 places you can create or download FREE YouTube intros with no watermark.

#### [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Blender is a free, open-source, ‘3D creation suite’. It’s great for modeling and animation, and you can even use it to make your YouTube intros.

This is an extremely powerful program. You can create cartoons and video game prototypes in Blender. This does mean that it’s probably not realistic for someone with no experience in animation to jump in and make a quick intro for their YouTube channel. However, if you want to learn Blender, all of the information you need is easily accessible through the tutorials on their site.

What’s a bit more realistic than learning an entire animation suite to make an intro is to download a premade template and just customize it in Blender. You can find YouTube intro templates that are editable in Blender on YouTube and [Velosofy](#velosofy).

#### [Movietools](http://www.movietools.info/)

This is a great site where you can download all kinds of free resources including video loops and animated backgrounds you can use to build YouTube intros.

You cannot download a complete Intro with your own text and/or logo from Movietools the way you can with Panzoid, but they can provide most of the resources you would need to build a sequence in Filmora or another editor.

Downloads from Movietools come as WMV (Windows Media) or MP4 files.

#### [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/)

 For a lot of creators, Panzoid is the default site they go to for YouTube intros, and that’s with good reason. Panzoid has an endless supply of intro templates (new ones are created weekly by members of their community) which you can edit right on the site.

A lot of the intro templates on Panzoid include music, and almost all of them include 3D text.

Click on a template you like and then click ‘open in clipmaker’.

In the clipmaker, you’ll be able to edit the template however you like. The main change you’ll want to make will probably be to the text – you’ll want it to say your channel name. In the menu on the left side of the screen, you’ll see an icon that looks like a cube. Click on it to bring up a list of the objects in the sequence.

The text will probably be under a heading such as ‘Group: All’, although there may be some variation on this depending on who built the template. Look for something that says ‘Group: Text’ in one of the dropdown menus and then look at where it says ‘Text: (the text from the template)’. There will probably be at least two fields like this for one word/line (they’re layers of the same thing). Make sure to edit them all to say the same thing or your intro will look odd.

Click the icon that looks like an arrow pointing down to choose your quality (next to mode) and format before you export. The highest quality will make your clip slow to download, but that could be worth it since you’ll probably get a lot of use out of this clip and you only need to download it once.

#### [Velosofy](https://www.velosofy.com/)

Velosofy has a ton of great intro templates you can download for free. The only complication is that the downloads are project files for programs like Sony Vegas or After Effects, making it difficult to use them unless you have those programs.

Luckily, one of the programs Velosofy has intro downloads for is [Blender](#blender), the free animation software discussed above. You can download YouTube intro templates from Velosofy to edit in Blender and end up with a great custom intro for free.

## 5 Tips for Making a Great Intro

Here are some tips for making an intro that supports the growth of your YouTube channel.

#### 1\. Keep it Under 10 Seconds

Someone who doesn’t know you, who is shopping around for the best video to watch on a particular topic, will not have the patience to sit through a long intro. In order to stop them from clicking away, you’ll need to keep your intro short. Ten seconds is the longest you can get away with, and that’s only if your intro is exciting and includes a lot of movement and music.

Five seconds will be better than 10 seconds in most cases.

#### 2\. Match Your Channel’s Branding

Your intro should help to strengthen your personal brand by using the same kinds of colors and fonts found in your channel art and thumbnails.

Beyond matching your visuals, your intro should support the general tone of your channel. If you tend to be upbeat in your videos, upbeat music and brighter colors are probably best. If you’re a tech channel, something sleek with a black background could be better.

#### 3\. Use Music

Viewers are likely to get distracted and click away during silent pauses. In order to keep their attention through your intro, you’ll need to include music, and maybe even a sound effect.

#### 4\. Include Your Channel Name

This might seem basic, but there are intros out there where the creator has overlooked this. One of the main purposes of your intro is to brand your video, so there’s nothing more important than including your channel name.

#### 5\. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro

Instead of putting your intro at the very beginning of your video, put a short clip ahead of it where you explain your topic. A viewer that is looking for you to get to the point quickly might click away if the first thing they see is the intro instead of information relevant to their search.

 What's your YouTube intro like? Can you think of a way you'd like to change or improve it?

Ever think about how to get a YouTube video trending? It can come down to picking a topic that's trending.

A trending topic is a subject which a lot of people are currently interested in. If you learn how to tap into what’s popular and cover it in creative and innovative ways then that will help your channel grow more quickly. You’ll get more views, more subscribers, and higher search rankings by following these simple tips.

1. **[Think of 'Trending' as Relevant](#relevant)**
2. **[Find Trending Topics Within Your Niche](#niche)**
3. **[Aim for Number 1](#aim)**
4. **[Success Doesn't Mean Making a Viral Video](#viral)**
5. **[The Subscriber Snowball Effect](#snowball)**

## **1\. Think of ‘Trending’ as Relevant**

Instead of thinking of a trending video as a video that everyone is doing, think of it as a subject that is relevant to a lot of people. You want to cover topics that a lot of people care about.

A lot of YouTubers see huge channels have a lot of success posting videos that are very focused on the personal life of the creator (i.e. ‘I had the WORST day’) or which have very vague or sensational titles (i.e. ‘The horse knows what it did’) and decide that those are the kinds of videos they want to do too. However, the only reason large channels are able to be successful with these kinds of videos and titles is that they are already big. These creators have already grown themselves huge audiences of people who know and are interested in them personally.

As a smaller creator, you will not be successful if you only aim to do videos that are focused on you and your life. For example, if you have 100 subscribers and make a vlog about how your day went, then you have 100 people who may potentially find that interesting. The content might be good, but it won’t help you grow.

**![find your niche](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/niche-find-your-niche.jpg)**

Taking on trending topics shouldn’t mean taking on topics you aren’t actually interested in or don’t care about. Every genre on YouTube has its own trends, and you will often know about them just by virtue of watching other channels in your genre and talking to people who are interested in the same things as you. For example, if you’re a Gamer and your friends are also Gamers then you probably already know what Gamers are currently interested in.

If you do need help determining trends, here are 2 ways to do it:

1. Visit 3 of the most popular channels in your genre (i.e. gaming, beauty, or prank) and see if there’s any overlap in the themes of their most recent videos.
2. Go to [Google Trends](https://trends.google.ca/trends/) and look at the categories most relevant to your genre. [To learn how to use Google Trends](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## **3\. Aim for Number 1**

**![think-in-divergent-way](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/think-in-divergent-way.jpg)**

Being trendy doesn’t mean you can’t be original. If you know what’s popular in your genre then that will enable you to ask yourself ‘what’s on-trend, but not being covered yet?’.

For example, if you know that relationship videos – topics like ‘how do you know a guy likes you?’ – are doing well then you can think about what other aspects of dating people might be interested in that don’t have many videos on them yet. If you’re one of the first to tackle something that’s on-trend you have a much better chance of getting that number 1 search engine ranking, and higher ranked videos always get more views.

There’s a common misconception that in order to grow your channel you need to make your videos go viral. The truth is that having one or two viral videos probably won’t help you much. People don’t subscribe to one video, they subscribe for consistently good content.

It’s much better to have 10 videos on a popular topic that are doing alright than it is to have that one big viral hit. Those 10 videos will consistently bring in new viewers to your channel who are more likely to subscribe because they can see you have other content they’re interested in.

## **5\. The Subscriber Snowball Effect**

**![snowball-effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snowball-effect.jpg)**

When you make multiple videos around a trending topic, they’re more likely to come up as ‘related’ to each other than if you only cover the topic in one video. If someone enjoys one of your videos on that topic and can see there’s another right there in the related videos, there’s a good chance they’ll click on it.

This gets you more views on multiple videos, and more subscribers because it builds the expectation that you’re going to continue to keep covering relevant topics. Having viewers click from video to video on your channel also increases your watch time, which YouTube’s algorithm takes as a sign that they should rank your videos higher in search results (getting you even more views).

For example, if you know that relationship videos – topics like ‘how do you know a guy likes you?’ – are doing well then you can think about what other aspects of dating people might be interested in that don’t have many videos on them yet. If you’re one of the first to tackle something that’s on-trend you have a much better chance of getting that number 1 search engine ranking, and higher ranked videos always get more views.

## **4\. Success Doesn't Mean Making a Viral Video**

There’s a common misconception that in order to grow your channel you need to make your videos go viral. The truth is that having one or two viral videos probably won’t help you much. People don’t subscribe to one video, they subscribe for consistently good content.

It’s much better to have 10 videos on a popular topic that are doing alright than it is to have that one big viral hit. Those 10 videos will consistently bring in new viewers to your channel who are more likely to subscribe because they can see you have other content they’re interested in.

## **5\. The Subscriber Snowball Effect**

When you make multiple videos around a trending topic, they’re more likely to come up as ‘related’ to each other than if you only cover the topic in one video. If someone enjoys one of your videos on that topic and can see there’s another right there in the related videos, there’s a good chance they’ll click on it.

This gets you more views on multiple videos, and more subscribers because it builds the expectation that you’re going to continue to keep covering relevant topics. Having viewers click from video to video on your channel also increases your watch time, which YouTube’s algorithm takes as a sign that they should rank your videos higher in search results (getting you even more views).

Do you have any of your own tips for how to get a YouTube video trending?
