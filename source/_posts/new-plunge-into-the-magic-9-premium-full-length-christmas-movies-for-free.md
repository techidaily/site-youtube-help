Video production entails a lot more than just composing and sharing your videos. You need the correct format to accomplish some tasks, especially when sharing them online. People use different devices and versions that are not automatically compatible with all video file formats. YouTube Shorts is one such video production platform that lets creators compose compelling short videos for sharing with their audience. More so, Shorts lets you record music, edit your video and get it ready for sharing.

## Why do we need to download and convert YouTube Shorts video?

Most YouTube Shorts are not easily accessible on mobile devices. Occasionally, users experience [YouTube Shorts not showing issue](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which prompts them to look for solutions for resolving the problem. You might be wondering whether converting your files is one such solution. Ideally yes! Find below, possible reasons for downloading and converting YouTube Shorts to MP4.

#### 1) Content optimization for other devices

Mobile technology keeps changing and various devices’ versions are continually on the rise. Some devices aren’t compatible with various [video formats and codecs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Converting the videos to MP4 opens avenues for access on any device and platform like emails.

#### 2) Compression

YouTube Shorts are designed to run for about 15 seconds. This is an indication that they are not fully compressed in terms of codec. Converting the files to MP4 format ensures that the file size is reduced, enabling playing on any platform without buffering. Luckily, there is no quality loss but it’s just the size is made smaller to fit any device.

#### 3) To support animated GIFs
