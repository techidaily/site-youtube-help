## How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?

The **YouTube Studio** is no longer in beta phase, which means that the feature is here to stay. This is good news for all video creators who frequently update their YouTube videos after they upload them, as they no longer have to go through the endless uploads just because they wanted to trim a video.

Make sure that youâ€™re signed into your YouTube channel, then click on your **profile picture** and select the **YouTube Studio (Beta)** option. On the left side of the screen, youâ€™ll be able to see a menu that contains different subcategories like **Analytics, Dashboard or Videos**, so just click on the **Videos** option and proceed to select a video youâ€™d like to trim. After the Videos submenu appears on the screen you should click on the **Editor** option and the video you selected will open in the YouTubeâ€™s video editor.

![Trim YouTube videos after uploading ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-editor-youtube-studio.jpg)

Click on the **Trim button** to start trimming the video and drag the **blue bars** located at the start and the end of the file to designate the portion of the video youâ€™d like to remove. Preview the changes and confirm what youâ€™ve made by clicking on the **Save** button located in the upper right corner of the screen and the new shortened version of the video will become available within a couple of hours.

#### Method 1: Trim on Timeline

YouTubers who donâ€™t want to rely on YouTubeâ€™s video editing capabilities can trim their footage with Filmora (to be honest, the Editor in YouTube platform has limited features). Filmora video editing software for PC and Mac computers offers a few different tools for trimming videos. After youâ€™ve created a new project in Filmora, you should import a video clip into the editor by clicking on the **Import** drop-down menu and select the **Import Media Files** option. Each file you add to a project will be displayed in the **Media tab**, and you can just **drag and drop** it to a video track on the timeline.

All you have to do in order to trim a video after youâ€™ve placed it on the timeline is drag **one of its ends to the left or to the right**. As you drag one of the clipâ€™s edges the editor will only display **the remaining footage** while rendering the rest invisible. If at any point you want to access a portion of the video youâ€™ve trimmed you just have to **extend the file by dragging it** until youâ€™re able to see the segment youâ€™re searching for.

On the left side of the screen, youâ€™ll be able to see a menu that contains different subcategories like **Analytics, Dashboard or Videos**, so just click on the **Videos** option and proceed to select a video youâ€™d like to trim. After the Videos submenu appears on the screen you should click on the **Editor** option and the video you selected will open in the YouTubeâ€™s video editor.
