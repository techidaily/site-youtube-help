## How to Prepare Before Making Your First Travel Video?

Now when you have got a glimpse of some of the best travel YouTube channels, you must be inspired to create your content as well. To work on memorable travel videos, I would recommend the following suggestions.

#### Record tons of footage

Most importantly, make sure that you have recorded a lot of content that you can include in your videos. You can later get rid of any content that you don’t like. Though, if you don’t have the right footage, then you won’t be able to create your video in the first place.

#### Focus on one thing at a time

While traveling, you can get overwhelmed and might try to include a lot of things in a single video. Instead, try to focus on one central idea for the video. For instance, you can make a video on your visit to a local market or a historic site. If you want to include more, then make a video collage of the entire trip.

#### Add voiceovers

A lot of content creators might not realize this, but voiceovers are extremely important in travel videos. Apart from the visual shots, you should include your experience of what you felt at that time. If you didn’t record your reaction in the original video, then use an editing tool like Filmora to add voiceovers later on.

#### Edit your videos with an excellent video editor

If you wish to come up with appealing travel videos, then a video editor would be a must-have tool for you. I would recommend using **Wondershare Filmora**, which is one of the most extensive and user-friendly video editors out there. You can easily clip the footage of your choice, add voiceovers, and include different transitions. There are tons of presets and media layers that you can include in your videos to make them stand out.
