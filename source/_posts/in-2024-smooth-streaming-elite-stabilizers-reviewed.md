# Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube

 When a YouTube video is shaky it’s hard to focus on what is happening in it. Camera shake is a huge distraction and, if it is a persistent problem in your YouTube videos, it will be hard to get subscribers. Shakiness is an easy problem to correct. With a bit of equipment, or a bit of creativity, it is easy to make sure your YouTube videos are nice and smooth.

## Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube

 This article will talk about different types of equipment you can use to stabilize your camera. For vloggers on a budget, there is even one tip on stabilizing your camera without camera equipment. Here are some of the best stabilizers for YouTube videos:

#### Part 1\. Tripod

 A tripod is a three-legged stand you can mount your camera to. The height of a tripod can be adjusted so you can set your camera up at the level that works best for you. Because tripods can stand alone you can set your camera up to record yourself without needing a helper.

 Tripods are the best choice for vlogs that revolve around you standing (or sitting) and delivering information, like opinion or beauty vlogs.

#### Part 2\. Monopod

 A monopod is like a tripod in the sense that you can adjust its height, but unlike a tripod a monopod has only one leg and cannot stand by itself. You will need a helper to stay with your camera if you plan to film yourself using a monopod. A monopod is more portable than a tripod, though, and can be used in a wider variety of places. You can even use a monopod to record aerial shots just by picking it up.

#### Part 3\. Pistol Grip

 A pistol grip is a handle you mount your camera to the top of. You can carry your camera around on top of the pistol grip, or you can mount the grip itself to your tripod or monopod. Once the grip is mounted you can use it to more easily control your camera movements. This is a great way to get even, steady, camera pans.

#### Part 4\. Selfie Stick

 A selfie stick is a long pole you mount your smartphone to one end of in order to take selfies from farther away. Selfie sticks also make great stabilizers if you are shooting video on your smartphone. To stabilize your smartphone place the handle of your selfie stick on the ground as if it were a monopod. When you are shooting using a selfie stick you can also hold it up in the air to get interesting high angle shots.

 Some YouTubers even like to shoot selfie-style vlogs where the hold the selfie stick just like they are taking a photo of themselves.

#### Part 5\. OIS – Optical Image Stabilization

 ‘Optical Image Stabilization’ is fairly new hardware which is built in to a lot of new smartphones, like the iPhone 6S Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. OIS reduces camera shake by a lot, although it is still a good idea to stabilize your smartphone while you record. OIS will also help you take sharper still photos without using any software.

#### Part 6\. Tables, Desks, Trees, ect

 If you do not have equipment, or cannot bring it where you want to shoot, then you can still record steady footage. You just have to get creative with where you put your camera. Any stable surface will do. You can set your camera down on a shelf in your house, a picnic bench, or up in a tree.

 If you are able to lean your elbows onto a desk or table while you hold your camera then that will also significantly cut down on camera shake. This works best for footage you are not in, or which you can have a helper film for you. If you are open to shooting a selfie-style vlog then you can use anything you can rest your hand on, like a fence or a railing.

| ![Polaroid Cube](https://images.wondershare.com/polaroid-cube.png) | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $100: Polaroid Cube+ Recording outdoor action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They're heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you're doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they're small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera's 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube's battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. **PROS** _\- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos_ _\- Multiple mounting options_ **CONS** _\- Low-quality built-in microphone_ _\- No preview screen_                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![Yi 4K](https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png)                 | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19" LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera's 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera's high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. **PROS** _\- Weighs only 3.4 Oz_ _\- Powerful electronic image stabilization_ **CONS** _\- Limited mounting capabilities_ _\- The camera's fisheye lens can distort footage_ |
| ![Nikon B500](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon's Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500's ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera's 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn't have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn't have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. **PROS** _\- Great connectivity features_ _\- 80x optical zoom_ **CONS** _\- No manual exposure controls_ _\- Limited ISO sensitivity_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Nikon A900](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f/3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900's ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200\. Consequently, this camera won't be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. **PROS** _\- 4K and Full HD video recording options_ _\- Manual exposure control_ **CONS** _\- Limited audio recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Sony a5100](https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony's a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony's E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. **PROS** _\- AF speeds exceed all expectations_ _\- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact_ **CONS** _\- Can't record 4K videos_ _\- Fake shutter sounds_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| ![Polaroid Cube](https://images.wondershare.com/polaroid-cube.png) | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $100: Polaroid Cube+ Recording outdoor action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They're heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you're doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they're small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera's 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube's battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. **PROS** _\- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos_ _\- Multiple mounting options_ **CONS** _\- Low-quality built-in microphone_ _\- No preview screen_                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![Yi 4K](https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png)                 | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19" LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera's 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera's high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. **PROS** _\- Weighs only 3.4 Oz_ _\- Powerful electronic image stabilization_ **CONS** _\- Limited mounting capabilities_ _\- The camera's fisheye lens can distort footage_ |
| ![Nikon B500](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon's Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500's ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera's 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn't have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn't have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. **PROS** _\- Great connectivity features_ _\- 80x optical zoom_ **CONS** _\- No manual exposure controls_ _\- Limited ISO sensitivity_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Nikon A900](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f/3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900's ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200\. Consequently, this camera won't be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. **PROS** _\- 4K and Full HD video recording options_ _\- Manual exposure control_ **CONS** _\- Limited audio recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Sony a5100](https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony's a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony's E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. **PROS** _\- AF speeds exceed all expectations_ _\- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact_ **CONS** _\- Can't record 4K videos_ _\- Fake shutter sounds_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| ![Polaroid Cube](https://images.wondershare.com/polaroid-cube.png) | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $100: Polaroid Cube+ Recording outdoor action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They're heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you're doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they're small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera's 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube's battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. **PROS** _\- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos_ _\- Multiple mounting options_ **CONS** _\- Low-quality built-in microphone_ _\- No preview screen_                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![Yi 4K](https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png)                 | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19" LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera's 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera's high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. **PROS** _\- Weighs only 3.4 Oz_ _\- Powerful electronic image stabilization_ **CONS** _\- Limited mounting capabilities_ _\- The camera's fisheye lens can distort footage_ |
| ![Nikon B500](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon's Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500's ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera's 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn't have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn't have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. **PROS** _\- Great connectivity features_ _\- 80x optical zoom_ **CONS** _\- No manual exposure controls_ _\- Limited ISO sensitivity_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Nikon A900](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f/3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900's ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200\. Consequently, this camera won't be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. **PROS** _\- 4K and Full HD video recording options_ _\- Manual exposure control_ **CONS** _\- Limited audio recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Sony a5100](https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony's a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony's E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. **PROS** _\- AF speeds exceed all expectations_ _\- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact_ **CONS** _\- Can't record 4K videos_ _\- Fake shutter sounds_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| ![Polaroid Cube](https://images.wondershare.com/polaroid-cube.png) | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $100: Polaroid Cube+ Recording outdoor action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They're heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you're doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they're small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera's 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube's battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. **PROS** _\- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos_ _\- Multiple mounting options_ **CONS** _\- Low-quality built-in microphone_ _\- No preview screen_                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![Yi 4K](https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png)                 | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19" LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera's 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera's high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. **PROS** _\- Weighs only 3.4 Oz_ _\- Powerful electronic image stabilization_ **CONS** _\- Limited mounting capabilities_ _\- The camera's fisheye lens can distort footage_ |
| ![Nikon B500](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon's Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500's ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera's 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn't have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn't have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. **PROS** _\- Great connectivity features_ _\- 80x optical zoom_ **CONS** _\- No manual exposure controls_ _\- Limited ISO sensitivity_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Nikon A900](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f/3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900's ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200\. Consequently, this camera won't be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. **PROS** _\- 4K and Full HD video recording options_ _\- Manual exposure control_ **CONS** _\- Limited audio recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Sony a5100](https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony's a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony's E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. **PROS** _\- AF speeds exceed all expectations_ _\- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact_ **CONS** _\- Can't record 4K videos_ _\- Fake shutter sounds_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
