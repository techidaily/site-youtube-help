## 1\. Have a Consistent Layout

Your thumbnails all must look like part of the same set. You want viewers to recognize your videos like yours, and they are more likely to do that if you build up a standard layout that they can start associating with you.

An example of a standard layout could be you in the middle of the screen wearing an expression that matches the theme of your video, with your title written underneath your face. Every individual thumbnail would still be different, but you and the text would always be in the same spot.

![Consistent Layout](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consistent-layout.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **2\. Use Your Face**

People feel automatically connected and drawn into images that make eye contact. This makes thumbnails which feature faces more click-able than thumbnails which don’t, in most genres (i.e. if you make food videos then this may not apply – featuring the food might be more important than featuring your face). [Check out more tips like this here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Also, if somebody recognizes you in your thumbnail from a previous video of yours, that will go a long way towards making them click.

## 3\. Use Graphics/Emojis that are On Topic

Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail. To make your thumbnails look polished, consider using small images (like emojis or hearts) to stand out. This will add color and personality to your thumbnail.

Make sure the images you choose are relevant to the topic of your video.

## 4\. Make Your Text Huge

If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.

Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. Keep it Clutter-Free

It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much. You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.

A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words. That way they won’t clutter your screen, and you can make them large enough to read on small-screened devices.

## FAQs about YouTube Video Comments

1. **Are Emojis Harmful to Use for YouTube?**

We all have heard rumors of using emojis in YouTube video titles or comments may damage views or reputation. However, it’s not true, and emojis have no negative consequences on YouTube.

Rather, you can attract more viewers and even improve YouTube SEO by using emojis. Google also allows emojis in search results, and data shows they rank better. You can use emojis for YouTube with complete peace of mind.

In my opinion, there will be no harmful effects on your views, subscribers, or credibility. Instead, you may be able to appeal to a younger crowd and get more clicks.

1. **Will adding Emojis Impact YouTube SEO?**

Many people don’t use emojis in their YouTube videos, fearing a negative impact. But all the rumors out there are just rumors without any truth. YouTube doesn’t penalize you in any way if you use emojis in comments, titles, or descriptions. You will not experience any penal actions by including emojis on YouTube.

Google is also friendly with emojis, and many websites use them to stand apart from the crowd. Using emojis on YouTube can be an excellent way to improve your SEO performance. Your videos will also have a chance to show up on Google results and YouTube. Emojis also help your videos look innovative to draw in more views.

**Final Thoughts**

Using emojis in YouTube comments is a great way to boost the popularity of your videos. You can also use emojis in your video titles and descriptions to appear more innovative. Additionally, emojis can improve your YouTube SEO performance and even help you rank on Google search results.

Copy-pasting emojis is a simple way to use them, but you can also go for other methods. TubeBuddy is a great choice if you want to eliminate the whole copy-paste scenario and include more types of emojis in your comments directly.
