## How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?

The **YouTube Studio** is no longer in beta phase, which means that the feature is here to stay. This is good news for all video creators who frequently update their YouTube videos after they upload them, as they no longer have to go through the endless uploads just because they wanted to trim a video.

Make sure that you’re signed into your YouTube channel, then click on your **profile picture** and select the **YouTube Studio (Beta)** option. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see a menu that contains different subcategories like **Analytics, Dashboard or Videos**, so just click on the **Videos** option and proceed to select a video you’d like to trim. After the Videos submenu appears on the screen you should click on the **Editor** option and the video you selected will open in the YouTube’s video editor.

Click on the **Trim button** to start trimming the video and drag the **blue bars** located at the start and the end of the file to designate the portion of the video you’d like to remove.

#### Method 1: Trim on Timeline

YouTubers who don’t want to rely on YouTube’s video editing capabilities can trim their footage with Filmora (to be honest, the Editor in YouTube platform has limited features). Filmora video editing software for PC and Mac computers offers a few different tools for trimming videos. After you’ve created a new project in Filmora, you should import a video clip into the editor by clicking on the **Import** drop-down menu and select the **Import Media Files** option. Each file you add to a project will be displayed in the **Media tab**, and you can just **drag and drop** it to a video track on the timeline.

All you have to do in order to trim a video after you’ve placed it on the timeline is drag **one of its ends to the left or to the right**. As you drag one of the clip’s edges the editor will only display **the remaining footage** while rendering the rest invisible. If at any point you want to access a portion of the video you’ve trimmed you just have to **extend the file by dragging it** until you’re able to see the segment you’re searching for.

## Details On Youtube Music

YouTube recently added 'YouTube Music' to assist advertise the website as a music-focused destination. You don't have to stay on the page for the music to keep playing, and there are no adverts if you pay for this service. Despite this, YouTube is still working to make its website more musical. The beauty of this is that even if you don't want to pay, you still have access to all of YouTube's music.

Using platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to distribute your music is a terrific way to get it out there. However, when compared to YouTube, there are several drawbacks. For starters, they are both expensive.

Second, because there are so many music platforms to choose from, audiences are likely to have a favorite, which could mean they don't have access to the platform you use to release your music. On the other hand, YouTube doesn't have any of these problems.

Many well-known musicians began their careers on YouTube. It provides a free platform for you to advertise yourself, regardless of your present level of popularity. Even some of the most popular profiles are musician accounts, demonstrating the site's potential for musical promotion.

YouTube playlists are limited to 5,000 videos, and YouTube Music playlists should be similarly restricted.

#### Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit

The 2 GB, file size limit is backed by a 15-minute maximum runtime restriction in YouTube's blog and Google's 2011 upload rules. All YouTube videos had to be under 10 minutes long until 2010, but on July 29, 2010, YouTube announced that the maximum video duration had been expanded to 15 minutes. According to the company, this was the most requested modification by YouTube viewers, and it's a natural move that takes full advantage of YouTube's new 2 GB size restriction.
