## Methods to add a subscribe button to your video

Viewers are not likely to subscribe to any channel if they are not guided. One best method is to engage a subscribe button to your video and draw the attention of as many as possible.

#### 1 Use Subscribe Green Screen

Put your green screen to work by subscribing to it. Follow these steps to produce eye-catching videos, with a call to action closing point.

**Step 1\. Set screen**

**Step 2\. Adjust lighting**  
Lighting is important to facilitate high-resolution video output quality. Put appropriate lighting settings to avoid directional shadows and get the best results.

**Step 3\. Set up the subject**  
Give ample space between the subject and the green screen for an effective outcome. If they are too close, there will be a reflection of the green screen on the subject. It isn't professional as it will be hard when it comes to matching to a different background.

![make your own green screen - set up the object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-3.png)

**Step 4\. Start filming**  
Begin to film your video and ensure you take various shots for comparison. It is good to film at different angles to see what works best.

**Step 5\. Polish the rough cut**  
Tune all the footage to perfect video clips. It will save your efforts when keying out green screen footage. Remove the unwanted parts by trimming. You can also do other edits like merge and split where necessary.

**Step 6\. Key out the footage and edit the green screen**  
Your footage is now ready, and you are now free to edit the green screen. It is better to engage reliable editing software to remove the green traces in the shot.

**Step 7\. Paste the new background**  
Any background concept can now fit in. Add your desired background video or image in a new layer below the subject. You can continue to make other necessary adjustments like sharpness and hue for reality.

# Top 9 Free YouTube Logo Makers

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

[0](#commentsBoxSeoTemplate)

Logos are a very important part of branding yourself, especially if you’re an online business or personality, and that's why we've made this list of YouTube logo makers. When you’re a part of a crowded platform like YouTube, having a logo definitely helps to differentiate yourself from all the other channels. In this article, we’ll be going over the top nine resources online for making YouTube logos for free.

1. [PIXLR EDITOR](#pixlr)
2. [GETPAINT](#getpaint)
3. [CANVA](#canva)
4. [DESIGNEVO](#designevo)
5. [LOGOMAKR](#logomakr)
6. [FOTOR](#fotor)
7. [SNAPPA](#snappa)
8. [LOGASTER](#logaster)
9. [COOLTEXT](#cooltext)

## 1\. [PIXLR EDITOR](https://pixlr.com/editor/)

PIXLR Editor is a powerful free online design tool that looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. If you’re going to design your YouTube Logo this way though, you’re going to have to design it from scratch.

## 2\. [GETPAINT](https://www.getpaint.net/)

GETPAINT.NET is very much like PIXLR in that it looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. But with GETPAINT.NET, you’re going to have to download it and run it from your computer to be able to use it.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622" border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 3\. [CANVA](https://www.canva.com/)

Unlike PIXLR and GETPAINT.NET, where you’ll have to design your logo from scratch, Canva comes with a lot of customizable design elements, stock images, and filters you can choose from. Canva is a simpler design tool. You won’t be able to work with layers or add effects to your text.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. [DESIGNEVO](https://www.designevo.com/)

Similar to Canva but even simpler and more focused on simple logo making is Designevo.

## 5\. [LOGOMAKR](https://logomakr.com/)

Logomakr is quite similar to Designevo but it allows you to work with layers.

## 6\. [FOTOR](https://www.fotor.com/)

Fotor is similar to Canva. Although you get less premade text templates, you can at least add a drop shadow to your text.

## 7\. [SNAPPA](https://snappa.com/)

Snappa is also a great online tool similar to Canva and Fotor.

WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)--Yearly</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 8\. [LOGASTER](https://www.logaster.com/)

For those wanting an even simpler option, one that automatically designs several different options for you simply based on your brand name and activity that your brand is involved in, Logaster is a good tool for that. Logaster will supply with you many different design options. You might find one that you like.

## 9\. [COOLTEXT](https://cooltext.com/)

Cooltext is a simple free website that gives you a library full of different text styles. You first choose the style that you want to customize and then replace the text. You can save your selection as a png and upload it into any of the other online design tools previously mentioned above.

If you want free templates that will work with a lot of these logo makers, check out our post on [YouTube Profile Picture Templates - Free Downloads!](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-profile-picture-templates-%E2%80%93-free-downloads%21-310.html)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. [GETPAINT](https://www.getpaint.net/)

GETPAINT.NET is very much like PIXLR in that it looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. But with GETPAINT.NET, you’re going to have to download it and run it from your computer to be able to use it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 3\. [CANVA](https://www.canva.com/)

Unlike PIXLR and GETPAINT.NET, where you’ll have to design your logo from scratch, Canva comes with a lot of customizable design elements, stock images, and filters you can choose from. Canva is a simpler design tool. You won’t be able to work with layers or add effects to your text.

## 4\. [DESIGNEVO](https://www.designevo.com/)

Similar to Canva but even simpler and more focused on simple logo making is Designevo.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. [LOGOMAKR](https://logomakr.com/)

Logomakr is quite similar to Designevo but it allows you to work with layers.

## 6\. [FOTOR](https://www.fotor.com/)

Fotor is similar to Canva. Although you get less premade text templates, you can at least add a drop shadow to your text.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. [SNAPPA](https://snappa.com/)

Snappa is also a great online tool similar to Canva and Fotor.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 8\. [LOGASTER](https://www.logaster.com/)

For those wanting an even simpler option, one that automatically designs several different options for you simply based on your brand name and activity that your brand is involved in, Logaster is a good tool for that. Logaster will supply with you many different design options. You might find one that you like.

## 9\. [COOLTEXT](https://cooltext.com/)

Cooltext is a simple free website that gives you a library full of different text styles. You first choose the style that you want to customize and then replace the text. You can save your selection as a png and upload it into any of the other online design tools previously mentioned above.

If you want free templates that will work with a lot of these logo makers, check out our post on [YouTube Profile Picture Templates - Free Downloads!](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-profile-picture-templates-%E2%80%93-free-downloads%21-310.html)
