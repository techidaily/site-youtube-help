It is one of the best travel YouTube channels to give you tips for traveling abroad on a shoestring budget. The channel is hosted by three friends and features tons of hacks to save your money while traveling.

#### 3\.  Drew Binsky

With over 1 billion views, Drew hosts one of the biggest travel-related YouTube channels. He started his channel with an aim to travel to every country in the world and records his experience on his channel. He is on the verge of completing his goal and you can join him too on his channel.

#### 4\.  100 Countries with Kara and Nate

As the name suggests, this is a dedicated travel channel that is owned by a couple, Kara and Nate. They started the channel with their mission to cover 100 countries by 2020, which they recently achieved. One of the reasons why they get millions of views on their videos is their authenticity. They share genuine travel experience on their channel that their viewers like the most.

#### 5\.  Vagabrothers

One of the best travel YouTube channels, it is owned by two brothers, Marko and Alex. Their travel videos are aesthetically pleasing and have a documentary style, elevating their overall visual appeal. If you are looking for an authentic experience, then you should check them out.

#### 6\.  Miss Mina

Having the best of food and travel in one place, this YouTube channel is owned by Mina Oh. The Korean YouTuber started her journey from authentic Asian food and gradually made travel videos. Today, she has almost a million subscribers with her videos having a blend of food and travel in one place.

#### 7\.  Best Ever Food Review Show

Owned by Sonny Side, this is one of the best travel YouTube channels, which is more inclined towards food. The host travels to various parts of the world and covers some of the most unique cuisines of that place. With over 5 million subscribers, Sonny is loved by many for his interesting take of different cultures and the food-related challenges he takes.

## How to Prepare Before Making Your First Travel Video?

Now when you have got a glimpse of some of the best travel YouTube channels, you must be inspired to create your content as well. To work on memorable travel videos, I would recommend the following suggestions.

#### Record tons of footage

Most importantly, make sure that you have recorded a lot of content that you can include in your videos. You can later get rid of any content that you don’t like. Though, if you don’t have the right footage, then you won’t be able to create your video in the first place.

#### Focus on one thing at a time

While traveling, you can get overwhelmed and might try to include a lot of things in a single video. Instead, try to focus on one central idea for the video. For instance, you can make a video on your visit to a local market or a historic site. If you want to include more, then make a video collage of the entire trip.

#### Add voiceovers

A lot of content creators might not realize this, but voiceovers are extremely important in travel videos. Apart from the visual shots, you should include your experience of what you felt at that time. If you didn’t record your reaction in the original video, then use an editing tool like Filmora to add voiceovers later on.

#### Edit your videos with an excellent video editor

If you wish to come up with appealing travel videos, then a video editor would be a must-have tool for you. I would recommend using **Wondershare Filmora**, which is one of the most extensive and user-friendly video editors out there. You can easily clip the footage of your choice, add voiceovers, and include different transitions. There are tons of presets and media layers that you can include in your videos to make them stand out.

#### Be authentic

In the end, make sure that you share a genuine experience with others. Try not to overly glorify a thing or provide a partial experience in your travel videos. Be authentic and share your experience while traveling to come up with personal yet beautifully-shot videos.

I’m sure that after reading this post on some of the best travel YouTube channels, you must be inspired as well. You can watch these channels to know more about a destination you are planning to visit or learn how to make interesting travel videos. To edit your videos, you can just take the assistance of a reliable application like Filmora and come up with stunning clips in less time.

Creative people don’t always like the idea of scheduling. You either feel inspired or you don’t (click here to [learn how to come up with video ideas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)).

[5 Tips To Get More Views With YouTube Video Optimization \[Free Checklist\] >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## 1\. Be Specific About Your YouTube Posting Schedule

Don’t just say you’re going to post a new video every week, decide on a specific day and time. If your subscribers expect new posts from you Thursdays at 4 pm, they will check your channel for those new posts every Thursday at 4 pm. This will make it easier for you to keep your view count close to your subscriber count.

The other benefit of being specific about your posting time is that the more specific you are, the less wiggle room you give yourself. Setting a clear deadline with yourself makes it harder to procrastinate.

## 2\. Make Your YouTube Upload Schedule Public

Post your schedule somewhere potential subscribers can see it like in your channel banner, intro, or video descriptions. The reason schedules work as a tool for growth is that they allow your audience to build up anticipation. It will be easier for newcomers to your channel to feel that anticipation if you start setting expectations for them on their first visit.

Committing publicly to a posting schedule means making a promise to your viewers. If you break that promise, they will be disappointed. This social pressure should help to keep you posting consistently.

## 3\. Remember That Posting on YouTube Takes Time

When you decide what day you want to post on, make sure that it’s a day where you have a lot of time to spend on things like writing your description, promoting your video, and answering comments.

It might be helpful to set a private deadline for yourself the day before your official post to upload your video and enter all of your metadata (title, description, tags). Then you can keep the video private until it’s time to post. You might also want to check out these tips on [how to export and upload faster](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## 4\. Bank YouTube Videos

It might happen that one week you’re full of ideas and energy and making videos is a breeze. It can be tempting to abandon your schedule and post more than normal, but you should resist that urge. Don’t waste all that energy – make the videos – but instead of posting them all right away, you should save them for weeks where you aren’t feeling the same enthusiasm.

## 5\. Set Realistic Goals

Your schedule shouldn’t leave you feeling burnt out. When you’re coming up with your schedule, think realistically about how much time you have to devote to YouTube and how much time you need to spend on a video. Give yourself enough time that you can keep to your schedule without feeling rushed.

Never make your schedule based on what other YouTubers are doing. Your lives are different.

Posting once a week is a good standard schedule, but if you like to spend a lot of time editing your videos and you work full time then maybe once a week isn’t realistic for you. Maybe you should post once every two weeks.

## The Best Days and Times to Post to YouTube

The best times to post are **Thursdays** and **Fridays** between 12 and 3pm (in the time zone of the majority of your subscribers – just check analytics in your Creator Studio). These are the times when there are the most viewers available to watch your videos. Monday and Tuesday are the worst days to post.

_Amy's scheduling advice: don't bite off more than you can chew!_

So, how many times do you upload per week, or per month? How often should you upload to YouTube?
