[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Quite recently, YouTube launched Shorts to compete with Tik Tok. At the time of this writing, the users in India have access to the fully functional version of the app. Although YouTube Shorts is available for both Android and iOS platforms, its functions are limited as the application is still in its Beta phase for the remaining part of the globe.

With that said, the following sections explain the step-by-step process on **how to upload a short video on YouTube** Shorts both from your smartphone and a PC.

## Part 1: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube from PC?

The fact is, if you are using a computer to upload short videos to YouTube, the process is identical to publishing your other, regular footage. However, there are a few guidelines that your clips must comply with so that the streaming platform could specifically identify them as YouTube Shorts. These norms include:

* Your videos must not be more than 60 seconds long in duration
* They must be shot in portrait orientation, ideally in the 9:16 aspect ratio
* The title or the description must contain ‘#Shorts’ (without quotes) in it

Once you have a video recorded using the first two guidelines from the above list, you can use the instructions given below to upload the media on YouTube:

#### Step 1: Select a Short Video to Upload

![Upload YouTube Shorts Video to desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-short-videos-on-youtube-pc.jpg)

Launch your favorite web browser on your PC, go to YouTube, make sure to sign in to your YouTube account, click the **Create** (**Camera**) icon from the top-right corner of the web page, click **SELECT FILES** on the **Upload videos** window, and locate, select, and upload a short video from your PC to the portal.

![Upload YouTube Shorts Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-short-videos-interface-on-youtube-pc.jpg)

#### Step 2: Mark the Video as Short

On the **Details** window that appears, add **#Shorts** in the **Title** or **Description** field, optionally pick a thumbnail from the suggested images present under the **Thumbnail** section (or upload a custom picture from your PC), select your preferred radio button from under the **Audience** section, make the other necessary changes if need be, and click **NEXT**. When the **Video elements** window comes up, choose your preferred options and elements, click **NEXT**.

![Mark YouTube Shorts Video in title and description](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mark-shorts-videos-on-youtube-pc.jpg)

#### Step 3: Publish the Short Video

On the **Visibility** window, choose your preferred radio button from under the **Save or publish** section or select **Schedule** to set a different time when the short video should be published automatically. Finally, click **SAVE** to publish the clip as a short video on YouTube from your computer.

![post YouTube Shorts Video  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/publish-youtube-shorts-video-desktop.jpg)

To sum up, uploading YouTube Shorts video from desktop has nothing different from uploading regular YouTube video besides the requirements listed at the beginning of this article. If you prefer to [edit videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for YouTube Shortson a computer, I recommend you to try our video editor [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is an ideal solution for YouTubers.

## Part 2: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube Mobile App?

The process of **uploading YouTube Shorts** from the mobile app is fairly simple compared to the method used on a computer. While using the app, you can either upload an existing video or shoot a new one from within the program itself then and there, add music and text, and upload it right away. Both these methods are explained below in detail:

**Note:** The guidelines for creating and uploading short videos to YouTube remain the same, regardless of the platform or device you use.

### Method 1: Upload an Existing Short Video

**Note:** Make sure to have the target video on the smartphone and that you have downloaded, installed, and signed in to the YouTube app before proceeding.

#### Step 1: Select a Video to Upload

![Select a Video to Upload as Shorts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-shorts-videos-to-upload-on-youtube.jpg)

On your Android or iOS smartphone, launch the YouTube app, tap the **+** (**Create**) icon from the bottom, tap **Create a Short** from the **Create** box that pops up from the bottom, tap **Upload** from the bottom-right corner of the next screen, and select and upload a short, 60 seconds video recorded in portrait orientation from your device’s storage to the app.

#### Step 2: Add Details

![add details to Shorts video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-details-to-youtube-shrots-video.jpg)

On the next screen, tap **NEXT**, user the **Music** and **Text** icons at the bottom-left corner to add a background music and caption to the video respectively, and tap **NEXT** from the top-right corner. On the next screen, enter a name for the video in the **Title** field along with the **#Shorts** tag, and tap **Select audience** to choose your preferred audience.

#### Step 3: Upload the Video

Finally tap **UPLOAD** from the top-right corner to upload the short video on YouTube.

### Method 2: Record a Short Video and Upload

**Step 1:** Record Shorts Video

Previously, I have introduced [how to record and upload YouTube Shorts videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), so I will keep the content concise here.

Please note you will not see the **Create a Short** option if you are outsides of India.

In the YouTube app, tap the **+** (**Add**) button and select **Create** **a Short**. Please note you will not see the **Create a Short** option if you are outsides of India.

Next, use the **Speed** and **Timer** icons to set the speed of the video and the countdown timer duration before the app starts recording the video when you press the **Record** button respectively.

Now tap the **Record** button from the bottom to start recording a video and stop to stop the recording. Make sure to shoot the footage in the portrait mode (ideally in the 9:16 aspect ratio). Tap **NEXT** from the bottom-right corner to proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Add Text and Music to the Short Video**

On the next window, use the **Music** and **Text** buttons from the bottom-left corner to add a background music and caption to the video, and tap **NEXT** from the top-right corner.

**Step 3:** **Upload and Post the Short Video**

**Conclusion**

Learning the process of **how to post short videos on YouTube** is fairly simple as long as you have the video recorded in the portrait orientation, it is up to 60 seconds long, and contains the ‘#Shorts’ tag (without quotes) in the title or description. The good thing is, if you don’t have access to the YouTube app on your smartphone, the method for **how to upload short video on YouTube** explained in the first section can be followed while using your desktop computer.

## Part 2: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube Mobile App?

The process of **uploading YouTube Shorts** from the mobile app is fairly simple compared to the method used on a computer. While using the app, you can either upload an existing video or shoot a new one from within the program itself then and there, add music and text, and upload it right away. Both these methods are explained below in detail:

**Note:** The guidelines for creating and uploading short videos to YouTube remain the same, regardless of the platform or device you use.

### Method 1: Upload an Existing Short Video

**Note:** Make sure to have the target video on the smartphone and that you have downloaded, installed, and signed in to the YouTube app before proceeding.

#### Step 1: Select a Video to Upload

On your Android or iOS smartphone, launch the YouTube app, tap the **+** (**Create**) icon from the bottom, tap **Create a Short** from the **Create** box that pops up from the bottom, tap **Upload** from the bottom-right corner of the next screen, and select and upload a short, 60 seconds video recorded in portrait orientation from your device’s storage to the app.

#### Step 2: Add Details

![add details to Shorts video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-details-to-youtube-shrots-video.jpg)

On the next screen, tap **NEXT**, user the **Music** and **Text** icons at the bottom-left corner to add a background music and caption to the video respectively, and tap **NEXT** from the top-right corner. On the next screen, enter a name for the video in the **Title** field along with the **#Shorts** tag, and tap **Select audience** to choose your preferred audience.

#### Step 3: Upload the Video

### Method 2: Record a Short Video and Upload

**Step 1:** Record Shorts Video

Previously, I have introduced [how to record and upload YouTube Shorts videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), so I will keep the content concise here.

Please note you will not see the **Create a Short** option if you are outsides of India.

In the YouTube app, tap the **+** (**Add**) button and select **Create** **a Short**. Please note you will not see the **Create a Short** option if you are outsides of India.

Next, use the **Speed** and **Timer** icons to set the speed of the video and the countdown timer duration before the app starts recording the video when you press the **Record** button respectively.

Now tap the **Record** button from the bottom to start recording a video and stop to stop the recording. Make sure to shoot the footage in the portrait mode (ideally in the 9:16 aspect ratio). Tap **NEXT** from the bottom-right corner to proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Add Text and Music to the Short Video**

On the next window, use the **Music** and **Text** buttons from the bottom-left corner to add a background music and caption to the video, and tap **NEXT** from the top-right corner.

## Part 1: How to Link a YouTube Video to TikTok Post?

There is no social network available online that gives more relevancy, popularity, and engagement than TikTok. Even though Tiktok's operations were only launched outside of China a few years ago, Tiktok has entirely taken over the social sphere when it comes to producing amusing and enjoyable short videos, which has been seen after a very long time after the app 'VINE' was shut down back in 2016.

You can reap multiple benefits if you're a content creator by connecting all your social media platforms. You can extend your reach and exposure to an immense number of people by linking your YouTube video to the TikTok post. Let's look at your options of connecting videos from **YouTube to TikTok** and highlight h**ow to connect TikTok to YouTube.**

Step 1: Open the TikTok app on your phone and tap on your **profile** option.

Step 2: Tap on the **edit profile** option and further select **Add YouTube to Your Profile** option.

Note: If you haven't previously linked your YouTube account to your TikTok channel, tapping on this will very certainly take you to another page with the **Google login screen**.

Step 3: Click on **"Allow" option**. By tapping on this, your YouTube channel will display as a link in your bio area.

Note: However, as we continue with this knowledge, it is worth noting that when you put your channel description and links under the videos you publish, the link is not **always clickable**. It is recommended that you keep with the bio section and conclude your short films by urging your viewers to visit your YouTube channel, which is included in the bio of your Tiktok profile.

## Part 2: How to Convert YouTube Video and Post to TikTok? \[3 ways\]

Further, we feel that differences in posting (such as formats, [aspect ratios](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and durations) should be accounted for when YouTube videos are converted into TikTok videos. Tiktok offers a 9:16 aspect ratio compared to most videos on YouTube, where the aspect ratio is primarily 16:9.

As for the format, the resolution can only be set to 1080p since TikTok only supports it to utilize the entire canvas. Tiktok is a platform that promotes videos ranging from 15 seconds to 3 minutes, compared to its initial support for content up to 15 seconds only. You will most likely have to resize your video if you plan to share it on Tiktok with all the above elements. Here are some of the video dimension details for TikTok.

* **Dimensions:** 1080 x 1920
* **Resolution:** 9:16 Aspect Ratio
* **File Format:**.mp4 or .mov
