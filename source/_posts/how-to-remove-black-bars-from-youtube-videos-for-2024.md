## What are YouTube Shorts?

YouTube Shorts is an app feature in YouTube that was introduced in 2020\. It has so far rolled out in more than 100 countries. It enables both artists and creators to compose short videos to express any feeling. It could be for entertainment or educational purposes. However, the videos are short, not exceeding 60 seconds, with a default length of 15 seconds. You also have the option to record your videos with music to add value to your video.

YouTube Shorts has two main features; a platform to watch short videos and a tool you can use to compose your own short-form videos. To watch the clip, just go to the “Homepage” and find several thumbnails for popular Shorts. Then click on a video and land on the vertical video player to watch the video. Likewise, you can use the thumbs up or down to like or dislike the video. Additionally, you can pause the video and post a comment or share the Shorts with other fans.

## Which role does music play in YouTube Shorts?

Music is always soothing to the soul. And using YouTube shorts music is a quick way to boost your video performance. Check below the importance of using music in your Shorts.

#### \- Generates important emotions

Music creates a good mood, giving your audience a positive feeling towards your YouTube Shorts. Any sound will touch the listener, making the videos more interesting and beautiful.
