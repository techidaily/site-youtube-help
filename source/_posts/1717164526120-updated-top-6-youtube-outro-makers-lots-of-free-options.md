## 6 YouTube Outro Makers With Templates

For even more End Screen Templates, [click here](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/free-youtube-end-screen-templates%21-plus%3B-how-to-build-your-301.html).

#### 1. [Outro Maker](https://outromaker.com/blog/free-outro-templates-for-download)

**Overview:** _Outro Maker provides interactive, animated, end screens for YouTube videos at a low monthly cost._

On Outro Maker’s home page there’s a testimonials section featuring well-known YouTubers like Kandee Johnson. They’ve definitely got the social proof to back up their claims about ease and quality.

Outro Maker is a paid service ($3 per month for the basic package) and the biggest issue facing it is that a lot of the features it charges for have become free features of YouTube’s own end screen tool. You get access to templates and a template maker with Outro Maker, though, and that may be the important thing for you.

#### 2. [Biteable](https://biteable.com/)

**Overview:** _Biteable skews more towards intros than outros, but makes up for it by being free._

Biteable has free video templates for YouTube intros and outros. You can use one of their pre-built options, or you can customize one of their video styles with your own logo, colors, and music.

This site definitely skews more towards intros than outros and they don’t really provide end screen cards. It would be up to you to choose a video style and customize it to make it work for your purpose, which shouldn’t be too much of a burden since the site is free.

#### 3. [Tube Arsenal](https://tubearsenal.com/)

**Overview:** _Tube Arsenal allows you to customize your intro on the site and download it for about $10._

Tube Arsenal has animated outro templates/end screen cards as well as an on-site clip editor you can use to customize them with your channel’s colors/logo/images. They have template cards with slots for videos/playlists as well as logos and subscribe buttons.

Tube Arsenal’s outros tend to cost $9 for 720p and $11 for 1080p. Some of their options include stylized ‘reveals’ of the ‘next video’ slots (i.e. they appear bit-by-bit from left to right) which will not be smoothly compatible with YouTube’s end screen tool (where the video previews will simply pop up).

#### 4. [Renderforest](https://www.renderforest.com/)

**Overview:** _Render Forest lets you download intros with 3D text for $20, and you can also use them as outros._

Render Forest is an intro maker that can also work as an outro maker (their templates aren’t set up like end screens). They have a lot of 3D options, which is something only a few other outro makers can offer, and they have been used by a lot of major brands.

One drawback of Renderforest is that it is significantly more expensive than other services on this list. It will cost you $20 for a 720p clip.

#### 5. [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/)

**Overview:** _Panzoid is a completely free service where you can get high-quality outros with 3D text._

Panzoid is a community-driven site where creators make templates for intros and outros and post them for other creators to customize and download for free. There are a lot of high-quality clips on Panzoid, and most of what you find is 3D (a major perk).

#### 6. [Intro Cave](https://introcave.com/)

**Overview:** _It costs $5 for a customized clip at Intro Cave._

As the name suggests, Intro Cave has a focus on intro videos. However, you can still use their customization system as an outro maker.

Although things do go on sale, they tend to charge $5 for a 720p clip.

## YouTube Outro Maker Alternative-[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

_“Is iMovie good for YouTube?”_

The iMovie is not only good for YouTube but various other social media platforms. The thing is, you have to compromise with the quality offered by Apple's video editor iMovie. Well, iMovie is perfect for getting started for beginners. But, the professionals and ones who want a bit high features than basic ones should look elsewhere. Thus, we always recommend alternatives to a particular software for our audience. In this article, there is a mention of Wondershare Filmora to overcome the drawbacks of iMovie.

Without further ado, let’s begin with **how to upload a video from iMovie to YouTube**. We want to lead with the best iMovie export settings, specific troubleshooting issues, and our alternative intro section to overcome iMovie's limitations.

## Part 1: How to Upload a Video from iMovie to YouTube?

iMovie is ideal for making YouTube videos if you are too basic and are not looking for advanced features. Remember that professionalism pays in these platforms and helps you stand better among others. If you're still interested in making introductory videos, here is a step-by-step guide on **uploading a video to YouTube from iMovie** on Mac first and leading with iPhone.

**Step-by-Step Tutorial on how to upload a video from iMovie to YouTube on Mac**

**Step 3: Edit Clips**

It’s time to edit video footage. Drag your video to the timeline, as shown below.

Then, you can trim and drag the edges of video clips to allow editing.

**Step 4: Add Titles**

You can add titles by clicking the Title tab and further drag the Title's template into the timeline.

**Step 5: Export the Video**

Click the **Export** button as follows after editing is over.

Select **YouTube** to upload your video over the platform directly.

**Step 6: Save**

After selecting the desired platform, click the **Next** tab to proceed with saving the file.

At last, save your video as shown below.

**Step-by-Step Tutorial on how to upload iMovie to YouTube from iPhone**

**Step 1: Share the iMovie Project**

Go to iMovie on your iPhone. Open the iMovie project on your iPhone and tap the Share button to select **YouTube**. Enter the information of **Title**, **Description**, **Size**, **Tags**, **Privacy**, and **Location** (optional).

**Step 2: Upload iMovie Files**

For ease of use, you can upload saved videos in Photo Library on your iPhone. Then, you can upload iMovie videos via the YouTube iOS app. **Sign In** to YouTube and click the **Camera** icon at the top of the Home page. Select your **iPhone** **Photo Library** file and set the video **Title**, **Description**, **Size**, **Tags**, and **Privacy**. Then, hit the **Upload** button to confirm.

## Part 2: The Best iMovie Export Settings for YouTube Videos

As we all know that iMovie consists of a bit long procedure to export projects. Here are some tips on the best iMovie export settings to avoid an unnecessary headache.

1. **Set small resolution:** Small resolution plays a more significant role, especially while uploading. Thus, you can set the smallest resolution in **the Email** tab of the **Export** button.

2\. **Change Export settings in the File tab:** There is a **File** tab under the Export button. Click it and find various settings that you need to change to get the best export settings for YouTube 2021\. Make the **Title** of the video as small as possible. Set the resolution at 1080P than 4K.

However, it isn't going to upgrade the resolution if your video is already in the 1080P definition. Now, the last setting that will crazily offer you the best quality and lots of space-saving. You have to select **Best (ProRes)** in quality settings for this purpose. These settings also take less time to upload to YouTube.

3\. **Compress is not for speed:** Various options you see in **the Compress**tab are not for speed. They are for how you save the video on a desktop. Thus, always choose the **Better Quality** tab than **Faster**.

4. **Do not export directly to YouTube:** iMovie is pretty basic and doesn't offer great settings to upload your video instantly. You may have to make changes to the uploaded video even if you do this as per our step-by-step guide mentioned above.

## Part 3: How to fix the “Failed to Upload to YouTube” Error on iMovie?

The "iMovie to YouTube failed" problem occurs when you directly upload a YouTube video from iMovie. The issue will result if you upload from any third-party uploader.
