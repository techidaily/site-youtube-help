## Before we start, is it legal to convert YouTube video to mp3

Downloading copyrighted videos is illegal, but millions of people do it anyway. Between 20-30 million active users are sharing copyrighted content every month in the US alone. Even though it's illegal, the entertainment industry hasn't done much to stop us.

The majority of users don't make money from sharing content, so they don't have a lot of incentive to stop. The reason we continue to download is that it's convenient and easy. People want to watch their favorite TV show or listen to their favorite song, and doing it legally can cost you more than you hope to part with.
