There are many components that are important for the success of your YouTube channel, but none of them are as [important as subscribers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/25-smart-and-proven-tactics--how-to-get-your-youtube-302.html).

Your subscriber count will tell you how well your channel is doing. Understanding who your audience is will enable you to come up with the content for your channel that is more perfectly suited to the tastes of the majority you’re your subscribers. Even though YouTube allows you to see who your subscribers are, monitoring the sub count in real time requires the use of subscriber trackers or counters ([more interested in seeing exactly who your subscribers are?](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/see-all-your-subscribers-on-youtube---easy-297.html)).

If you would like to keep track of the ever-changing number of subscribers to your channel, or gather information such as the sub counts and views of other YouTube channels, then using a live subscriber counter is a good choice.

Here are the top 12 YouTube subscriber counters:

* [Social Blade](#socialblade)
* [Subscribercounter.com](#subscribercounter)
* [Akshatmittal.com](#akshatmittal)
* [LiveCounts.net](#livecounts)
* [Grin.co](#grin)
* [YouCount.github.io](#youcount)
* [RealTimeSubCount.com](#realtimesubcount)
* [SubscriberCount.org](#subscribercount)
* [Live.SumScreen.com](#livesumscreen)
* [YTCount.com](#ytcount)
* [Realtime Subscriber Count](#realtimesubscriber)
* [Realtime Sub Count](#realtimesub)

## Top 12 Best YouTuber Subscriber Trackers You Should Use

### 1. [Social Blade](https://socialblade.com/youtube/realtime)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker - Social Blade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-social-blade.jpg)

This is probably the best tool you can use to monitor how the number of subscribers to any YouTube channel changes in from second to second. What's more, Social Blade allows you to compare up to three different YouTube channels and you can also keep track of the number of subscribers top channels on YouTube have. In addition, you will be able to see how many videos they have uploaded and how many views they got. To start monitoring sub counts live via Social Blade simply enter the name of a channel and let the algorithm do the rest.

### 2. [Subscribercounter.com](https://subscribercounter.com/channel/UCuD18o7XuDBqMlDTCrJ2ReA)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker Subscribercounter.com](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-subscribercounter.jpg)

This website doesn't provide advanced statistics, but it is easy to use. If all you need to find out the number of subscribers of a channel, insert the channel's name into the search box. The search results also include the number of videos featured on the YouTube channel as well as the number of views. Subscriber Counter is an easy-to-use tool, but just don't expect much more than basic information from this live subscriber tracker.

### 3. [Akshatmittal.com](https://akshatmittal.com/)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: Akshatmittal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-akshatmittal.jpg)

The users of this tool can get the accurate number of subscribers for any YouTube channel in real time and they are also granted an insight into the number of views and comments a channel has received and how many videos are uploaded to it. Channel username, channel ID, YouTube URL can all be used as search terms on Askat Mittal's YouTube Real-time subscriber counter.

A fringe bonus of Askat Mittal’s service is that the information is all displayed beautifully alongside the channel art of the YouTubers you look up.

### 4. [LiveCounts.net](https://livecounts.net/channel/filmora.io)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: livecounts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-livecounts.jpg)

If you are in need of an easy-to-use YouTube subscriber counter, then LiveCounts is a strong option. However, if you want to learn more about a YouTube channel than its subscriber count, such as the number of videos a creator has uploaded, how many views they have received, or how many comments their videos have, then LiveCounts may not be a good choice since it only monitors subscriber numbers in real time. There is a views tool, but it does not appear to be working.

On LiveCounts you can change the color of the display background.

### 5. [Grin.co](https://grow.grin.co/live-youtube-subscriber-count/filmora.io)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: Grin.co](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-grin-io.jpg)

You can either search the channels by entering the user or a channel name into the search bar.

### 6. [YouCount.github.io](https://youcount.github.io/)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: YouCount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-youcount.jpg)

YouTube creators in need of an advanced real-time subscriber count tool will without a doubt benefit from YouCount. Besides a live subscriber counter, YouCount also provides advanced statistics such as real-time trends with a 30-second refresh rate as well as information about total views or the number of videos the channel you are researching features.

Some of the more unique tools on YouCount allow you to compare a channel’s recent success (the statistics of the last 5 videos posted there) with the popularity of the channel as a whole. This is a good way to see if a channel is picking up momentum.

### 7. [RealTimeSubCount.com](https://realtimesubcount.com/#!/UCuD18o7XuDBqMlDTCrJ2ReA)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: RealTimeSubCount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-realtimesubcount.jpg)

Getting real-time statistics from the YouTube Subscriber Count is easy because all you need to do in order to get an exact number of subscribers for your channel, or any other YouTube channel, is to type the channel's name into the search box. There is also an app for Android Smartphones available if you like to work on your smartphone. The version of the app for iPhones should become available in the near future.

### 8. [SubscriberCount.org](https://www.subscribercount.org/filmoraio)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: SubscriberCount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/SubscriberCount-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

Information like the number of video uploads, views, and the creation date of the YouTube channel are all easily accessible via the SubscriberCount website. Simply insert the name or the URL of the channel you'd like to find out more about and enjoy the benefits.

### 9.  Live.SumScreen.com

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: SubscriberCount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/live-sum-screen-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

You can either insert the name (or the ID sequence from the channel’s URL if the channel doesn’t have a custom URL) of the channel into the search bar on the website's welcome screen and be just one click away from real-time subscriber counts.

\[Update August 21, 2018: Live.SumScreen tracker feature is currently unavailable\]

### 10. [YTCount.com](https://www.ytcount.com/web/filmora.io/UCuD18o7XuDBqMlDTCrJ2ReA/)

![YT Count YouTube Subscribers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/YTCount-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

This is a website that offers an app you can use on your[iPhone, iPad or iPad Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ytcount-subscriber-count/id1091736385?mt=8), or even on your [Android smartphone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ytcount). All versions of the app are free to download and allow you to follow several YouTube channels simultaneously, receive a notification every time you reach a milestone, and customize the app however you want.

### 11. [Realtime Subscriber Count](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/realtime-subscriber-count/jgfaljbminhalkeonllnkfeacehcgkdi?hl=en-GB)

![Realtime Subscriber Count](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/realtime-subscriber-count-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

Although remarkably easy to use this Google Chrome extension doesn't offer much more than basic statistics, such as the current number of subscribers or the number of videos the channel features. YouTubers who are looking for more advanced analysis of data should look elsewhere because this extension doesn't provide any additional information. Realtime Subscriber Count is a great way to keep track of subscriber numbers while you browse, but that is all it can do.

### 12. [Realtime Sub Count](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sub-count/id977966794?platform=iphone&preserveScrollPosition=true#platform/iphone)

![YouTube Sub Count app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/realtime-sub-count-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

The Realtime Sub Count app is only available for iOS devices. This app was launched in April 2017 and, even though it provides some detailed information, it is still under development. If you decide to download this app you will be able to save your favorite channels and always get accurate data for them. The app updates every two seconds.

There are many components that are important for the success of your YouTube channel, but none of them are as [important as subscribers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/25-smart-and-proven-tactics--how-to-get-your-youtube-302.html).

Your subscriber count will tell you how well your channel is doing. Understanding who your audience is will enable you to come up with the content for your channel that is more perfectly suited to the tastes of the majority you’re your subscribers. Even though YouTube allows you to see who your subscribers are, monitoring the sub count in real time requires the use of subscriber trackers or counters ([more interested in seeing exactly who your subscribers are?](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/see-all-your-subscribers-on-youtube---easy-297.html)).

If you would like to keep track of the ever-changing number of subscribers to your channel, or gather information such as the sub counts and views of other YouTube channels, then using a live subscriber counter is a good choice.

Here are the top 12 YouTube subscriber counters:

* [Social Blade](#socialblade)
* [Subscribercounter.com](#subscribercounter)
* [Akshatmittal.com](#akshatmittal)
* [LiveCounts.net](#livecounts)
* [Grin.co](#grin)
* [YouCount.github.io](#youcount)
* [RealTimeSubCount.com](#realtimesubcount)
* [SubscriberCount.org](#subscribercount)
* [Live.SumScreen.com](#livesumscreen)
* [YTCount.com](#ytcount)
* [Realtime Subscriber Count](#realtimesubscriber)
* [Realtime Sub Count](#realtimesub)

## Top 12 Best YouTuber Subscriber Trackers You Should Use

### 1. [Social Blade](https://socialblade.com/youtube/realtime)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker - Social Blade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-social-blade.jpg)

This is probably the best tool you can use to monitor how the number of subscribers to any YouTube channel changes in from second to second. What's more, Social Blade allows you to compare up to three different YouTube channels and you can also keep track of the number of subscribers top channels on YouTube have. In addition, you will be able to see how many videos they have uploaded and how many views they got. To start monitoring sub counts live via Social Blade simply enter the name of a channel and let the algorithm do the rest.

### 2. [Subscribercounter.com](https://subscribercounter.com/channel/UCuD18o7XuDBqMlDTCrJ2ReA)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker Subscribercounter.com](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-subscribercounter.jpg)

This website doesn't provide advanced statistics, but it is easy to use. If all you need to find out the number of subscribers of a channel, insert the channel's name into the search box. The search results also include the number of videos featured on the YouTube channel as well as the number of views. Subscriber Counter is an easy-to-use tool, but just don't expect much more than basic information from this live subscriber tracker.

### 3. [Akshatmittal.com](https://akshatmittal.com/)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: Akshatmittal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-akshatmittal.jpg)

The users of this tool can get the accurate number of subscribers for any YouTube channel in real time and they are also granted an insight into the number of views and comments a channel has received and how many videos are uploaded to it. Channel username, channel ID, YouTube URL can all be used as search terms on Askat Mittal's YouTube Real-time subscriber counter.

A fringe bonus of Askat Mittal’s service is that the information is all displayed beautifully alongside the channel art of the YouTubers you look up.

### 4. [LiveCounts.net](https://livecounts.net/channel/filmora.io)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: livecounts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-livecounts.jpg)

If you are in need of an easy-to-use YouTube subscriber counter, then LiveCounts is a strong option. However, if you want to learn more about a YouTube channel than its subscriber count, such as the number of videos a creator has uploaded, how many views they have received, or how many comments their videos have, then LiveCounts may not be a good choice since it only monitors subscriber numbers in real time. There is a views tool, but it does not appear to be working.

On LiveCounts you can change the color of the display background.

### 5. [Grin.co](https://grow.grin.co/live-youtube-subscriber-count/filmora.io)

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: Grin.co](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-grin-io.jpg)

Furthermore, this easy to use real-time subscriber counter allows you to share the latest statistics about your YouTube's leading channel easily to Facebook or Twitter. You can either search the channels by entering the user or a channel name into the search bar.

If you’re looking to get free views on YouTube, rather than just assuming views are free, it probably means you’re looking into alternative ways to jumpstart the growth of your channel (i.e. [buying views](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/everything-you-need-to-know--how-to-buy-youtube-views-292.html)). The best way to grow your channel is to focus on putting out quality content consistently. We do not recommend the following methods, but they do exist. Here are a couple of alternatives to purchasing views which are along those same lines (if you want to know how to grow organically without resorting to tactics like these, [click here](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/14-tactics-that-actually-work%21-how-to-gain-more-subscribers-300.html)) When YouTube first started, getting views and subscribers was a lot easier. That’s not to say that creator didn’t have to work hard on their channels, just that they had a lot less competition.

YouTube has become so popular now that it is not uncommon for creators to look for alternative ways to stand out. Some might choose to buy views to kick start the organic growth of their channels (which is not a good idea), while others are looking for free ways of getting those views.

Two of these alternative methods are:

[**Part 1: Get More Views with View Exchange Platforms**](#exchange)

[**Part 2: Get More YouTube Views with Bots**](#bots)

[![Get free YouTube Subs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-free-youtube-subs-banner.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## #1: View Exchange Platforms

There are a variety of websites to choose from, but the main purpose is the same: you watch other people's videos in order for them to watch your videos.

Here are the most popular view exchange platforms:

#### 1. [View2be](https://www.view2.be/)

![View Exchange Platforms - View2be](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view2be-free-youtube-views.jpg)

View2be accounts are free. After you sign up, you will need to start watching videos from other YouTube publishers who are also members at View2be in order to earn coins. One of the differences between View2be and other view exchange platforms is that here, you can also complete some other tasks such as liking videos in order to earn more coins.

You can then spend the coins on views and likes for your own videos.

#### 2. [GrowViews](http://www.growviews.com/)

![View Exchange Platforms - GrowViews](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/grow-views-youtube-views-exchange.jpg)

With GrowViews, you will need to login with your YouTube account. This is how the platform lists your YouTube videos.

After signing in, you just need to click on the Play button. The site’s player will work on the background, playing videos from other YouTube creators.

For each video that you watch, you will get 1 credit that you can then exchange for views on your own videos.

#### 3. [YTMonster](https://www.ytmonster.net)

![View Exchange Platforms - YTMonster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/YTMonster-youtube-views-exchange-platform.jpg)

Just like with the previous two view exchange platforms mentioned, you can also create a free account with YTMonster. This will give you access to a dashboard where you can choose how to use the credits that you earn as well as keep track of what you have already spent credits on.

With YTMonster, you will be able to contact other video publishers like you and exchange not only views but comments, likes, and even subscriptions as well. You can even start campaigns to grow your YouTube channel as quickly as you can.

#### 4. [KingdomLikes](https://kingdomlikes.com)

![View Exchange Platforms - KingdomLikes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/KingdomLikes-youtube-views-exchange-platform.jpg)

At KingdomLikes, you also create a free account. This platform isn’t only for YouTube views, it is for the exchange of social actions across multiple websites. One of the main advantages of using the KingdomLikes is that you can also use this same platform to get likes or views on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, as well as on YouTube.

Just like with the other platforms, you will need to watch other people's videos in order to earn views for yourself.

#### 5. [AddVisits](https://www.addvisits.com/free-youtube-views-likes-subscribers.php)

After creating your free account on AddVisits you'll get to a dashboard where you'll need to enter the URL of the YouTube video you want free views for.

AddVisits reviews each video submitted in this way to ensure that it complies with YouTube’s Terms of Service. Once your video is approved, you define how many points you are willing to give to people who watch your videos or like them. In exchange, you watch other people's videos and get points as compensation. You can then exchange those points for more views or likes.

## #2: Get More Views with YouTube View Bots

When most people think about getting free views on YouTube, they immediately think about bots.

Bots can be dangerous for your channel. The wrong bot can really hurt your search rankings and if you get caught using bots you can lose your account.

If you are going to try a bot, make sure you choose one that offers high retention views (most can’t, but may say they can). High retention views mean YouTube interprets the data as someone watching your video for a period of time, vs just clicking on it and then leaving the page. A bot that can’t offer high retention views just ends up making it look like a lot of people clicked on your video, but none of them liked it enough to watch. That will cause YouTube to rank your video very low in its search results.

[Making great content](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-better-youtube-videos--278.html) and polishing up your [YouTube SEO skills](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html) will help you grow your channel over time, and this is probably the best way to go. However, you have a lot of options for how to get free views on YouTube if you want to try to kick start that growth. Besides, using a good video editing software is also important. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) provides lots of templates and effects which allows you to edit YouTube videos faster and better.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you’re looking to get free views on YouTube, rather than just assuming views are free, it probably means you’re looking into alternative ways to jumpstart the growth of your channel (i.e. [buying views](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/everything-you-need-to-know--how-to-buy-youtube-views-292.html)). The best way to grow your channel is to focus on putting out quality content consistently. We do not recommend the following methods, but they do exist. Here are a couple of alternatives to purchasing views which are along those same lines (if you want to know how to grow organically without resorting to tactics like these, [click here](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/14-tactics-that-actually-work%21-how-to-gain-more-subscribers-300.html)) When YouTube first started, getting views and subscribers was a lot easier. That’s not to say that creator didn’t have to work hard on their channels, just that they had a lot less competition.

YouTube has become so popular now that it is not uncommon for creators to look for alternative ways to stand out. Some might choose to buy views to kick start the organic growth of their channels (which is not a good idea), while others are looking for free ways of getting those views.

Two of these alternative methods are:

[**Part 1: Get More Views with View Exchange Platforms**](#exchange)

[**Part 2: Get More YouTube Views with Bots**](#bots)

[![Get free YouTube Subs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-free-youtube-subs-banner.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## #1: View Exchange Platforms

There are a variety of websites to choose from, but the main purpose is the same: you watch other people's videos in order for them to watch your videos.

Here are the most popular view exchange platforms:

#### 1. [View2be](https://www.view2.be/)

![View Exchange Platforms - View2be](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view2be-free-youtube-views.jpg)

View2be accounts are free. After you sign up, you will need to start watching videos from other YouTube publishers who are also members at View2be in order to earn coins. One of the differences between View2be and other view exchange platforms is that here, you can also complete some other tasks such as liking videos in order to earn more coins.

You can then spend the coins on views and likes for your own videos.

#### 2. [GrowViews](http://www.growviews.com/)

![View Exchange Platforms - GrowViews](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/grow-views-youtube-views-exchange.jpg)

With GrowViews, you will need to login with your YouTube account. This is how the platform lists your YouTube videos.

After signing in, you just need to click on the Play button. The site’s player will work on the background, playing videos from other YouTube creators.

For each video that you watch, you will get 1 credit that you can then exchange for views on your own videos.

#### 3. [YTMonster](https://www.ytmonster.net)

![View Exchange Platforms - YTMonster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/YTMonster-youtube-views-exchange-platform.jpg)

Just like with the previous two view exchange platforms mentioned, you can also create a free account with YTMonster. This will give you access to a dashboard where you can choose how to use the credits that you earn as well as keep track of what you have already spent credits on.

With YTMonster, you will be able to contact other video publishers like you and exchange not only views but comments, likes, and even subscriptions as well. You can even start campaigns to grow your YouTube channel as quickly as you can.

#### 4. [KingdomLikes](https://kingdomlikes.com)

![View Exchange Platforms - KingdomLikes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/KingdomLikes-youtube-views-exchange-platform.jpg)

At KingdomLikes, you also create a free account. This platform isn’t only for YouTube views, it is for the exchange of social actions across multiple websites. One of the main advantages of using the KingdomLikes is that you can also use this same platform to get likes or views on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, as well as on YouTube.

Just like with the other platforms, you will need to watch other people's videos in order to earn views for yourself.

#### 5. [AddVisits](https://www.addvisits.com/free-youtube-views-likes-subscribers.php)

After creating your free account on AddVisits you'll get to a dashboard where you'll need to enter the URL of the YouTube video you want free views for.

AddVisits reviews each video submitted in this way to ensure that it complies with YouTube’s Terms of Service. Once your video is approved, you define how many points you are willing to give to people who watch your videos or like them. In exchange, you watch other people's videos and get points as compensation. You can then exchange those points for more views or likes.

## #2: Get More Views with YouTube View Bots

When most people think about getting free views on YouTube, they immediately think about bots.

Bots can be dangerous for your channel. The wrong bot can really hurt your search rankings and if you get caught using bots you can lose your account.

If you are going to try a bot, make sure you choose one that offers high retention views (most can’t, but may say they can). High retention views mean YouTube interprets the data as someone watching your video for a period of time, vs just clicking on it and then leaving the page. A bot that can’t offer high retention views just ends up making it look like a lot of people clicked on your video, but none of them liked it enough to watch. That will cause YouTube to rank your video very low in its search results.
