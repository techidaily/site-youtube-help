### Gather Content Ideas

Gather content, even before you make a YouTube channel on mobile. You can start with a series of videos talking about your company, products, or industry and then launch the channel once they are all done. If you can't think of any content on your own, try searching around online to see if others have already created videos of this sort and have posted them online. Then, use those videos as examples when you make your content.

### Logo and Thumbnail Design

### How to make a logo for YouTube on mobile?

Once you are up with content creation, you will have to create a thumbnail for your video. Attractive and catchy thumbnails that persuade searchers to click on your video are critical. Here we will see how to create a logo for a YouTube video on mobile. For this purpose, Canva.com can create attractive thumbnails and a Catchy logo. Using this tool, you can create, edit and customize graphics for your YouTube videos.

### Quality of Video is Important

Don't just put up videos willy-nilly. Think about what content would work for your brand and audience. The content needs to be engaging, relevant, and inspiring so people will keep coming back for more videos. You don't have to have the latest video equipment either – think about the type of content that would work best.
