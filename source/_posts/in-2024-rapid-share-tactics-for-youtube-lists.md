## Rapid Share Tactics for YouTube Lists

YouTube has become the most popular video-sharing platform on the internet, with users from all over the world uploading and watching videos daily. You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.

But what if you've created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we've put together an extensive guide on **how to** **share a YouTube playlist** on your computer and mobile devices.

So, let's get started with our guide without any further delay!

## Why Doesn't The Share Function In The Playlist Work?

Firstly, let's figure out why the "Share" function doesn't work. The "Share" function in the playlist does not work because it is set to "private," and YouTube doesn't allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to "public" in the following way:

Step1 Head to the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.

Step2

* **Click** the three-line **"Menu"** icon at the top-left of your screen.
* Go to **"Library."**
* Scroll down to the **"Playlist"** section.

Step3 Select your playlist labeled as **"Private."** On the next page, click the **"Private"** option in the playlist details section and select **"Public"** to change the visibility of your playlist.

Once the privacy setting has been changed, the **"share"** function will work as intended.

The point is that your intro should be to the point. It means that you must never prolong your intro for any reason. Again here comes the element of relevancy.

It means that you must keep your intro as short as possible as it allows you to capture the audience in a far better manner. A short intro will make sure that you are getting the attention that you need when it comes to your channel. So it will boost your channel traffic a lot.

**3\. It must be in line with your channel theme**

Again it is critical that your intro is relevant to your channel. It means that the intro made should represent your channel’s content instead of anything else. It will make sure that you get the best and most relevant audience.

This will once again boost your channel as well as traffic surge will also occur. You will get the best outcome that will make it possible for you to channel the traffic wherever you want. This, in turn, will also boost your channel revenue in case of monetization.

**4\. Awesome Music**

It is the most important part that will impact your YouTube intro. Good music will make sure that you get the best outcome and the users are attracted. There are many YouTube channels that were only recognized as their music was awesome.

**5\. Clean Visuals**

HD and the high quality intro is the key to your channel’s success. It is highly regarded as the best way to attract people. You must spend time to make sure that it looks great and to the point. This is one of the ways to make sure that your intro looks good and awesome.

**6\. Technically Sound**
