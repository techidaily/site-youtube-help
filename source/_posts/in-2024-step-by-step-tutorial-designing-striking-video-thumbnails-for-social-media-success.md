## 1\. Have a Consistent Layout

Your thumbnails all must look like part of the same set. You want viewers to recognize your videos like yours, and they are more likely to do that if you build up a standard layout that they can start associating with you.

An example of a standard layout could be you in the middle of the screen wearing an expression that matches the theme of your video, with your title written underneath your face. Every individual thumbnail would still be different, but you and the text would always be in the same spot.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Consistent Layout](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consistent-layout.jpg)

## **2\. Use Your Face**

People feel automatically connected and drawn into images that make eye contact. This makes thumbnails which feature faces more click-able than thumbnails which don’t, in most genres (i.e. if you make food videos then this may not apply – featuring the food might be more important than featuring your face). [Check out more tips like this here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Also, if somebody recognizes you in your thumbnail from a previous video of yours, that will go a long way towards making them click.

## 3\. Use Graphics/Emojis that are On Topic

Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail. To make your thumbnails look polished, consider using small images (like emojis or hearts) to stand out. This will add color and personality to your thumbnail.

Make sure the images you choose are relevant to the topic of your video.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Make Your Text Huge

If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.

Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.

## 5\. Keep it Clutter-Free

It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much. You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.

A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words. That way they won’t clutter your screen, and you can make them large enough to read on small-screened devices.

YouTube is a social platform that relies on visually exciting material to attract the audience. Just like a book with an appealing cover compels a person to pick it up and read, it is significant to display and advertise your YouTube channel in a way that makes viewers click and browse through the channel.

Despite creating a beautiful banner on your desktop screen, it might end up distorted on a mobile screen if the recommended sizes for all kinds of gadgets are not followed. Hence, choosing your YouTube channel art dimension is essential since it is the viewer's first impression. To commence with, you must be careful about your **YouTube banner size** and **channel art dimensions**. Are you wondering how to create the perfect banner or cover photo as we know it? Worry not as we are going to tell you the exact details to achieve an ideal YouTube banner size that fits all devices from computers to phones.

## Part 1: The Recommended YouTube Banner Size

According to YouTube's official standards, the recommended banner size is 2560×1440 pixels. However, the minimum image dimensions are 2048×1152 pixels. To ensure that your text is visible regardless of the screen size, sticking to the "safe area" of 2560×423 pixels is the best option. Why are these sizes significant?
