## Part 3: How to Make Intros with iMovie on iPhone

YouTubers who don’t want to install any third-party intro maker on their iPhones can create an intro for their video with iMovie. However, the process can be a bit technical while the results you are going to get may not be visually impressive.

The first thing you will need to do is create a new project, and select a photo you are going to use as a background. Once you place the photo onto the timeline and set its duration you can proceed to export it as a video.

You can skip this step if you want to use a video file you recorded with on your own as the background for the intro. In either case, you will have to import the video files you want to use to make an intro into a project you’re working on and place them on the timeline.

You can then proceed to create a text box and insert the text you want to appear in the intro. Optionally you can apply transitions between the video clips you included in your intro or add music that matches the intro’s style. Preview the intro to make sure that you like the final result and continue working on other parts of your video.

## Part 3: How to Make Intros with iMovie on iPhone

YouTubers who don’t want to install any third-party intro maker on their iPhones can create an intro for their video with iMovie. However, the process can be a bit technical while the results you are going to get may not be visually impressive.

The first thing you will need to do is create a new project, and select a photo you are going to use as a background. Once you place the photo onto the timeline and set its duration you can proceed to export it as a video.

You can skip this step if you want to use a video file you recorded with on your own as the background for the intro. In either case, you will have to import the video files you want to use to make an intro into a project you’re working on and place them on the timeline.

You can then proceed to create a text box and insert the text you want to appear in the intro. Optionally you can apply transitions between the video clips you included in your intro or add music that matches the intro’s style. Preview the intro to make sure that you like the final result and continue working on other parts of your video.

## Part 3: How to Make Intros with iMovie on iPhone

YouTubers who don’t want to install any third-party intro maker on their iPhones can create an intro for their video with iMovie. However, the process can be a bit technical while the results you are going to get may not be visually impressive.

You can skip this step if you want to use a video file you recorded with on your own as the background for the intro. In either case, you will have to import the video files you want to use to make an intro into a project you’re working on and place them on the timeline.

You can then proceed to create a text box and insert the text you want to appear in the intro. Optionally you can apply transitions between the video clips you included in your intro or add music that matches the intro’s style. Preview the intro to make sure that you like the final result and continue working on other parts of your video.
