You make your original content, so it might not be obvious why you would want stock footage. Stock footage doesn’t replace your own recorded videos, though, it just supplements them by adding a bit of variety. Stock video footage is especially useful for things like intros and transitions.

Here are 4 YouTube channels where you can find free stock footage. To learn how to download videos directly from YouTube, check out the tutorial **[here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

**Royalty-free Video Footage:**

[1\. Free Stock Footage Archive](#freestockfootage)

[2\. Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage](#beachfront)

[3\. HDStockFootageFree](#hdstock)

[4\. NatureClip: Free Stock Footage](#natureclip)

## **1\. [Free Stock Footage Archive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy8fgmCsEDIKMWx4Zi0CvNQ/featured)**

This channel has a massive library of free stock footage, which is updated semi-regularly. They have backgrounds, ‘glitch’ effects (which look really cool when combined with [Filmora’s green screen tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)), and more classic stock footage options like street scenes and forests. There’s a particularly interesting playlist of black and white videos, which could be useful if you’re trying to make a darker or creepier project.

Besides video footage, this archive also has some sound effects.

## **2\. [Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage](https://www.youtube.com/user/Beachfrontprod/featured)**

This stock footage channel has lots of nature scenes and wildlife. There’s some urban and technology stuff too, but their nature stuff is especially great. It’s easy to find what you’re looking for on Beachfront B-Roll because they have themed playlists for different seasons, as well as for things like ‘sky’ or ‘water’.

On their **[website](http://www.beachfrontbroll.com/)**, you can find even more content and multiple download options.

## **3\. [HDStockFootageFree](https://www.youtube.com/user/HDStockFootageFree)**

This channel doesn’t have a large variety of different kinds of footage – all of it is pretty industrial. There’s footage of trains, trucks, trash, and people working. It’s the kind of stuff that you might not find on other stock footage channels because it’s not necessarily pretty.

## **4\. [NatureClip: Free Stock Footage](https://www.youtube.com/user/NatureClip)**

The name of this channel pretty much says it all. They’ve got tons of great nature videos, including scenery, animals, flowers, and views. It’s not all everyday nature either, they’ve got cool macro shots of bugs, and a lot of more exotic animals. One particularly noteworthy playlist is devoted entirely to slow-motion clips.

If you know of anywhere else, people can get free stock footage, say so in the comments!

If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software **Wondershare Filmora**. It provides special effects, stock photo & video, sound library, etc., which will definitely enhance your productivity and helps to make money by making videos much accessible.

## Why your phone doesn't post videos to YouTube

Despite learning how to upload to YouTube from iPhone, you may be perplexed to realize that your phone refuses to post videos to YouTube. What could be the reason?

#### 1) YouTube issues

In most cases, the problem doesn't arise from your phone but from YouTube. This streaming app may also experience some hitches along the way. Remember that even if your phone sync with your YouTube account to upload videos from the "Camera Roll," YouTube isn't managed from the Camera Roll but the YouTube app directly. You can solve the issue by signing out of your YouTube account and signing back in.

#### 2) Connection Strength

Some videos may appear quite large and cause a time-out during the upload process. Check your Wi-Fi or internet connection strength to determine if it needs a boost or wait until the streaming strength is strong for a quick upload. Test your internet speed by searching "internet test speed" on Google. Then click the "Run Speed Test" in the search box. A window will open and give you an estimate of the Mbps that your connection is operating at. If too low, switch to other alternatives.

#### 3) Verify your YouTube account

Verifying your account will help you to enjoy YouTube's full features. It's then that you'll manage to upload videos without any drawbacks. Also, that's when you'll manage to upload longer videos that go beyond the 15-minute duration.

#### 4) Pay attention to the video size

There is a limit for videos to post to YouTube. If it is too large or long, the upload will cancel before completion.

#### 5) Be patient

YouTube can save your partial upload for 24 hours. So, you can continue to upload from where you left. Learn to be patient as there could be a surge of user traffic, especially during evenings.

## Why your phone doesn't post videos to YouTube

Despite learning how to upload to YouTube from iPhone, you may be perplexed to realize that your phone refuses to post videos to YouTube. What could be the reason?

#### 1) YouTube issues

In most cases, the problem doesn't arise from your phone but from YouTube. This streaming app may also experience some hitches along the way. Remember that even if your phone sync with your YouTube account to upload videos from the "Camera Roll," YouTube isn't managed from the Camera Roll but the YouTube app directly. You can solve the issue by signing out of your YouTube account and signing back in.

#### 2) Connection Strength

Some videos may appear quite large and cause a time-out during the upload process. Check your Wi-Fi or internet connection strength to determine if it needs a boost or wait until the streaming strength is strong for a quick upload. Test your internet speed by searching "internet test speed" on Google. Then click the "Run Speed Test" in the search box. A window will open and give you an estimate of the Mbps that your connection is operating at. If too low, switch to other alternatives.

#### 3) Verify your YouTube account

Verifying your account will help you to enjoy YouTube's full features. It's then that you'll manage to upload videos without any drawbacks. Also, that's when you'll manage to upload longer videos that go beyond the 15-minute duration.

#### 4) Pay attention to the video size

There is a limit for videos to post to YouTube. If it is too large or long, the upload will cancel before completion.

#### 5) Be patient

YouTube can save your partial upload for 24 hours. So, you can continue to upload from where you left. Learn to be patient as there could be a surge of user traffic, especially during evenings.
