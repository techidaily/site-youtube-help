There are plenty of Text effects built in Filmora, you can apply motions and animation to texts, titles, subtitles, end credits and openers as well. Each title preset will present different effects. You can add multiple text boxes and place the text to any position in need. Besides writing texts to video, you can select the target font, size and color and customize the text effect in detail as well. To add text to a video in Filmora is easy, just follow the steps below:

![ Add Text to Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-advanced-text-edit-interface.jpg)

* Open up Filmora and drag a clip into your timeline. Then, go to   **Text/Credit.**
* Find a style that you like and drag it into your timeline where you want your text to appear. Make sure your text is selected in your timeline and click the   **Advanced Text Editing** icon, which looks like a pen and paper.
* Insert your own words and drag your text to where you want it on the screen. Adjust the size by dragging the blue squares which surround your text.
* To change the color of your text, go into the **Customize**  menu. You will find it near the top left of your screen. While you are in **Customize** there will be a section called **Fill**. This is where you select the color of your text. You can even change the fill type to ‘gradient fill’ and have your text transition between two colors.
* All of Filmora’s text options are animated – they fade, move around the screen, or perform some other type of action as they appear and disappear.

### Top 3 Tips for Adding Text to YouTube Videos

#### 1\. Leave Room

If you know you are going to add text to your video then make sure you leave room for it in your frame. Consider standing off to one side instead of directly in front of your camera. You do not want to have to choose between not using text, making your text really small, or placing it over your face.

While planning out your frame and leaving room for your text, consider what color you are going to make the words and whether it will stand out and look good against your background.

#### 2\. Bigger is Better

People should be able to read your text without putting in any extra effort, such as straining their eyes to make out small words. If it takes effort to read your text then a lot of people will just ignore it. Your text should be big enough that somebody watching your video on their smartphone screen – where everything is shrunk down – can read it easily.

It is easier to make your text larger when you stick to titles, keywords, and short sentences.

#### 3\. Do Not Overuse

Text is a great tool for making something stand out. However, if you try to use text to emphasize too much of what you say it will lose its effect. Text does not stand out anymore once viewers get too used to seeing it. Too much text can even get annoying and cause people to click away from your videos.

Try to use text to emphasize only the most important things you say.

### How to Add Text to video in YouTube after uploading

Sometimes, we have uploaded a video to YouTube and then want to add subtitles/cc to the video later. The good news is that YouTube is not only a site for videos but is also the place where you can edit your videos in an instant. As you have read, adding text and captions to the uploaded YouTube videos is just a breeze.

Of course, you can only add and edit texts and captions to the video under your YouTube account. Here are the steps on how you can add text to your videos with YouTube Video Editor after the video is uploaded.

* Go to [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/) then sign in to your account. After sign in your YouTube account, click your avatar and select **Creator Studio** to enter the creator studio interface.
* Click the **Video Manager** tab and in Videos section you will see all your videos uploaded to YouTube. Select the video that you want to add captions to and then select **Subtitles/CC** after clicking Edit button.
* Add Captions/Subtitles

![ Add Text to Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-text-youtube-video-editor.jpg)

While YouTube may have already created the subtitles automatically for your video with its speech recognition technology. If it does, you will see something like Published: English (Automatic) to the right of your video. If the automatically generated subtitles is not correct, you can edit it to improve the accuracy. Select the line that needs modification to make the edits.

If there is no auto-subtitles, you can choose from 3 ways to add subtitles and closed captions to the video: Upload a file, Transcribe and auto-sync and create new subtitles or CC.

![ Add Text to Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-ways-to-add-youtube-subtitles.jpg)

**Upload a file:** upload a text transcript or timed subtitles file.

**Transcribe and auto-sync:** Type or paste in a full transcript of the video and subtitle timings will be set automatically.

**Create new subtitles or CC:** Create subtitles and closed captions by typing them in as you watch the video.

If you already have a caption file which contains both text and time codes, just click **Upload** a file and upload the text to the video.

* Once everything is okay, you can change the name of the video and you can do it in the box beside Project.

**Cons of Using YouTube Video Editor**

When you make use of this editor, you cannot shorten the clips for music. Moreover, since it is an online editor, you need to refresh the page in order to do the changes. Aside from YouTube Video Editor, you can use Adobe Premier Pro, MAGIX Vegas Pro, OpenShot and Avidemux.

From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complementary editing suite. Check the best [YouTube video editor alternatives](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from this complete guide to find out more YouTube video editor alternatives if you want to add text to video with more features and customization.

### Top 3 Tips for Adding Text to YouTube Videos

#### 1\. Leave Room

If you know you are going to add text to your video then make sure you leave room for it in your frame. Consider standing off to one side instead of directly in front of your camera. You do not want to have to choose between not using text, making your text really small, or placing it over your face.

While planning out your frame and leaving room for your text, consider what color you are going to make the words and whether it will stand out and look good against your background.

#### 2\. Bigger is Better

People should be able to read your text without putting in any extra effort, such as straining their eyes to make out small words. If it takes effort to read your text then a lot of people will just ignore it. Your text should be big enough that somebody watching your video on their smartphone screen – where everything is shrunk down – can read it easily.

It is easier to make your text larger when you stick to titles, keywords, and short sentences.

#### 3\. Do Not Overuse

Text is a great tool for making something stand out. However, if you try to use text to emphasize too much of what you say it will lose its effect. Text does not stand out anymore once viewers get too used to seeing it. Too much text can even get annoying and cause people to click away from your videos.

Try to use text to emphasize only the most important things you say.
