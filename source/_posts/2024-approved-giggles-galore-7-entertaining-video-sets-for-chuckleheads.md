Aspiring comedians used to have to find success performing in bars and clubs before they’d get the chance to make big audiences laugh. Now funny people can reach millions of viewers on YouTube, and all they need are funny video ideas. [Generating great video ideas](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-come-up-with-better-youtube-video-ideas-391.html) isn't always easy, but I'm here to help you get over that minor speed bump.

Let's dive into the world of YouTube comedy videos and find out which ideas can help you launch your career as a comedian.

## 7 Comedy YouTube Video Ideas

1. [Do a Skit](#one)
2. [Start a Funny Series](#two)
3. [Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos](#three)
4. [Machinima and Gameplay Skits](#four)
5. [Parody Videos](#five)
6. [Bloopers](#six)
7. [Lip Sync Video](#seven)

#### 1\. Do a Skit

YouTube is the perfect medium for short, generally between one and ten minutes long comedy sketches. The majority of the audience on YouTube isn't patient enough to sit through a half-hour show, no matter how funny it is (at least not until you have a large fan base).

Your skit can be about literally anything, as long as it's short and effective. Having your own unique sense of humor is a crucial factor in ensuring the success of the sketches you post online.

#### 2\. Start a Funny Series

Try producing a pilot episode of a comedy series for your YouTube channel. Don't worry about the budget too much because if your ideas are good even a DIY approach will be enough.

Producing a funny series requires dedication and commitment to that goal, so don't let yourself be discouraged easily.

#### 3\. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos

Posting cute videos on your YouTube channel will certainly help you get attention online. The Internet loves videos of adorable babies, cats, dogs and other charming animals. Including these types of videos on your channel can be a good way to boost your subscriber count.

It is important to note that your content must be unique. Re-posting funny animal videos you find online won't get you far and will make it impossible to monetize your channel.

#### 4\. Machinima and Gameplay Skits

The term machinima means creating a cinematic production by re-using material from video games. Gameplay skits and machinima videos are a great way of reaching millions of gaming fans who enjoy good comedy videos.

The gaming industry is on the rise, and the audience that wants to watch video game-related content is growing every day. However, these types of videos require an in-depth knowledge of the gaming world, and you really have to know the games you draw from in order to make this idea work.

#### 5\. Parody Video

A well done, poignant parody never fails to make people laugh. Pop culture provides an endless source of TV shows, movies, and songs that can be used for your parody videos. When pop stars release big new music videos, they always get parodied by someone on YouTube within the first few days in order to capitalize on the trend while it’s fresh.

Parody videos will provide you with an opportunity to showcase your skills and enable you to show the world that you are a talented, relevant comedian.

#### 6\. Bloopers

We all make mistakes. Blooper videos enable us to at least laugh at them. Experienced YouTubers know how easy it is to flub a take, but it takes a brave creator to make an entire video from the shots they messed up.

#### 7\. Lip-Sync Video

Have you ever imagined what it’s like to be a pop star? Lip-sync videos offer the opportunity to step into someone else's shoes for a moment and have fun with it. Knowing the song you’re lip-syncing and having good timing can help, but you can hardly go wrong producing a video of yourself pouring your soul into a song you're lip-syncing.

Lip-syncing to tunes from the most popular stars in the world will enable you to gain traffic from people looking for content related to those songs and artists.

Your vlogging voice is usually a louder version of the way you always talk, but in some situations, you might like to try out a completely different voice. There is a lot of software out there that can make you sound like a completely different person. You can change your voice for comedic effect, or to mask your identity. There are a lot of reasons you might want to change your voice in a YouTube video. If you are a YouTube gamer playing as some kind of non-human character then it might make sense for you to use a voice that suits that character for your voiceovers. Or, you might want to create multiple characters for your vlog and give them all unique voices.

There is a wide variety of voice changer software out there. Some are simple voice recorders that allow you to add a premade effect while others offer in-depth audio editing. This article will introduce you to some of the best voice changers available at different price points, from free to $100\. Because your vlog posts will rarely be live programs that only alter your voice in real-time and do not allow you to record have been excluded from this list.

#### 1\. AthTek Voice Changer – Free

![voice changer AthTek](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-changer-AthTek.JPG)

AthTek’s free voice changer for Windows is a very simple program that will allow you to change the pitch and speed of your voice in an audio recording. It does not work in real-time unless you purchase the $15 ‘all in one version. Usually, as a YouTuber, you will be working with pre-recorded audio, though.

#### 2\. Audacity – Free

Audacity is not specifically a voice changer; it is a full-feature audio editing program for Mac or PC. If your goal is only to use a false voice then Audacity might be more complicated than you want as you will have to make all your changes manually. There are no pre-set voices, but you can change both the pitch and tempo of your audio recordings and do a lot of other detailed editings. You can record audio using Audacity, or import audio files to edit. Audacity is available at Audacityteam.org.

#### 3\. Voxal Voice Changer – Free
