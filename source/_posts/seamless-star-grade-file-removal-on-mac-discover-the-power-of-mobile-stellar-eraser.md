[Stellar Eraser for Mobile](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) /[4. Working with the Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/) /**4.2\. Erasure Process**

# **4.2\. Erasure Process**

 You can securely erase data from your device by using the erasure feature of **Stellar Eraser for Mobile** . You can choose an erasure method from a list of 11 data erasure methods.

**To erase data using** **Stellar Eraser for Mobile** **:**

 1\. Run **Stellar Eraser for Mobile** . Plug the iOS/Android device into the computer.

 2\. The **Devices**  tab lists all the attached iOS/Android devices. The screen which appears is displayed below:

![Stellar Help](https://www.stellarinfo.com/help/public/onlinehelp_img/stellar-eraser-for-mobile-1-mac-standard-en/erasure-process/device-tab.png)

 A device message appears after its connection. **For example** : In the above screen, an Android device shows the message '**Turn On USB Debugging** '. To continue from this stage, USB Debugging must be allowed on the Android device's end. Similarly, for iOS devices '**Trust Device** ' message appears.

**_Note_**   _: For more information, please refer to the section ' **[How to enable the USB Debugging mode in your phone?](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/)**  ' in the next topic of this user guide._

 3\. All the devices along with their information like process (**Erase** **)** , USB port name, type, progress bar, status, ECID/IMEI, and serial number are displayed. You can also see icons for connectivity status, SIM card status, and FMD (Find my device) locked/unlocked status.

![Stellar Help](https://www.stellarinfo.com/help/public/onlinehelp_img/stellar-eraser-for-mobile-1-mac-standard-en/erasure-process/devices-information.png)

 4\. You can preview the device's information either in **Grid view** ![Stellar Help](https://www.stellarinfo.com/help/public/onlinehelp_img/stellar-eraser-for-mobile-1-mac-standard-en/erasure-process/grid-view.png) or **List view** ![Stellar Help](https://www.stellarinfo.com/help/public/onlinehelp_img/stellar-eraser-for-mobile-1-mac-standard-en/erasure-process/list-view.png) .

* In the **Grid view** , the devices get displayed in a grid-like structure, and also the devices can be sort using the **Sort By** option. The **Sort By** option allows sorting the devices based on the following information/criteria: USB ID, Name, Serial Number, Type, Size, ECID/IMEI, and Status.

![Stellar Help](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/).png)

* In the **List view** , the devices get displayed in a list.

 9\. Click **Start**  to start erasing the devices.

**_Note:_**   _If you wish to erase a single device, you can start the process by simply clicking the play button in the middle._

 10\. A warning message appears asking to proceed to the erasure process. Click **Proceed** .

![Stellar Help](https://www.stellarinfo.com/help/public/onlinehelp_img/stellar-eraser-for-mobile-1-mac-standard-en/erasure-process/warning-proceed.png)

**_Note:_**   _If you do not wish to see the warning message the next time you erase a device, select the **Don't Show Again** check-box._

 The erase process for a device takes place in five different phases, to understand these phases refer to the next section of **[Erasure Stages](https://lightailing.sjv.io/k0ez0m)**  .
