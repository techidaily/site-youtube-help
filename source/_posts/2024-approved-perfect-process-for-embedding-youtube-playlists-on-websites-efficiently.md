### Embedding a YouTube Playlist on Website Using WordPress Plugin

The plugin is the simplest way to add a YouTube Playlist to your WordPress website. This will help you get this done in no time without having to write any code for the process.

With plugins like [YouTube Feed Pro by Smash Balloon](https://smashballoon.com/youtube-feed/), you can extend your website's functionality and create, customize, or embed a YouTube playlist with just a few clicks of a mouse.

To embed and add a YouTube playlist on your website page/post, do the following steps in sequence:

Step1 Launch a browser on your PC and head to your **WordPress website's login page**. Sign in to your dashboard using your username and password.

Step2 Click the **"Plugins"** option from the left-hand side menu on the WordPress dashboard. Now, click **"Add New"** and use the search option to find and install the **YouTube Feed Pro** plugin. Afterward, click the **"Activate"** option to enable the plugin.

Step3 Click the **"YouTube Feed"** option from the left menu and open **"All Feeds."** On the next page, click **"Add New"** at the top left of the screen.

![creating new feed in the youtube feed plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/creating-new-feed-in-the-youtube-feed-plugin.png)

You will now be asked what type of feed you want to create. Select **"Playlist"** and click **"Next."**

![embedding playlist on website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/embedding-playlist-on-website.png)

Step4 You need to [create your YouTube API Key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started), copy it, and paste it into the pop-up. Click **"Add"** to connect your YouTube account to the plugin.

Step5 Select the Playlist you want to display on your WordPress website and take its **ID**. Paste that in the next pop-up window and click **"Next"** to continue the process.

![adding playlist id to embed in website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/adding-playlist-id-to-embed-in-website.png)

Your YouTube playlist will be connected to your WordPress website. To further customize it, select the template you want and click **"Next."** You can also configure the **Feed Layout** and **Color Scheme.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![customizing youtube playlist embedded in website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/customizing-youtube-playlist-embedded-in-website.png)

Step6 Once you are done with customization, click the **"Embed"** option on the top-right side of the screen, and a pop-up window will appear. Next, click **"Add to a Page,"** and a list of pages on your website will be displayed.

![adding playlist to website page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/adding-playlist-to-website-page.png)

Choose your page and click **"Add"** at the bottom of the pop-up window. You'll be directed to a new page where you can embed the feed. Click the **"Plus"** icon at the top-left of the screen, search for **YouTube Feed** and choose the **Feeds for YouTube** block to embed and add your playlist.

That's about it! You've successfully embedded a YouTube playlist on your WordPress website.

### Embedding a YouTube Playlist on a Website Using oEmbed Code

Another method to embed a YouTube playlist on your WordPress website is to use oEmbed Code. This method requires basic CSS, HTML, or Java knowledge; otherwise, you won't be able to customize your playlist.

Moreover, this method is too complicated for beginners, and you will miss the customer support provided by WordPress plugin developers in case of any mishaps.

To use the oEmbed Code method, do the following steps:

Step1 In the first step, head to your YouTube account and access the Playlist you want to embed. Next, click the three dots below it and copy its URL.

Step2 Now, login to your WordPress dashboard and open the post or page editor where you want to add the playlist.

Step3 Paste the URL directly in the editor and click **"Update"** to save the changes.

WordPress will grab your playlist from YouTube and automatically show it in your post using oEmbed. The outcome is a single video with a menu that your viewers can click to see other videos in the playlist.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Embedding a YouTube Playlist on WebsiteUsing <iframe >

Another way to embed a playlist of your YouTube channel on your WordPress site is by using the iFrame code with the following step-by-step instructions:

Step1 In the first step, launch a browser on your desktop or laptop and go to your **YouTube channel.**

Step2 Now, head to the YouTube playlist you want to embed, click the **"Share"** icon, and a pop-up window will appear.

Step3 Choose the **"Embed"** option, and a new lightbox pop-up will appear, having your playlist's embed code. Click **"Copy"** to save the code on your clipboard.

![embedding youtube playlist in website using iframe code](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/embedding-youtube-playlist-in-website-using-iframe-code.png)

Step4 Log in to your WordPress dashboard and open the page/post editor where you want to embed the playlist. Click the **"Plus"** icon, search for **"custom HTML,"** and select **"Custom HTML block"** to add to the page/post.

Now, paste the iFrame embed code you've copied from YouTube and click "Update" at the top-right of the screen to save the changes and embed your playlist.

This method will also display one video with a menu from where you and your website viewers can access the playlist. Moreover, there are few customization options to change the appearance.
