However, it is also notable for non-linear editing capacities, great visual/audio effects, and the simple creation of masks.

## 13\. Windows Movie Maker

Available for: Windows

Everyone knows about this editor since it’s been around for a long time. Microsoft stopped releasing new versions, but Windows Movie Maker remains relevant in 2018\. It’s definitely not the most advanced product in the market and it is best suited for simple projects and beginner-level users. However, its cutting and editing tools are pretty solid, while transitions, animations, and visual effects are quite simple to pull off.

* Already included on many Windows-based computers
* Sourcing footage from a computer or camera
* Direct sharing to YouTube and other networks

## Are you ready for something better?

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

As you can see, there is no shortage of free video editing software suites. However, free software does tend to be either very limited, or very specifically targeted (i.e. Blender is specifically for animators). Wondershare's [**Filmora** **Video Editor**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great choice for YouTubers and other video creators who are starting to grow out of programs like Windows Movie maker. You can even try all the features for free, for as long as you like! Exports from the free trial do have a watermark, though.
