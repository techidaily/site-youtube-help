## 1\. Choosing A Potential Partner

Before you think about how you’re going to approach someone you need to decide who you want to approach.

A lot of people automatically want to approach their YouTube hero, and that can be a mistake. Liking your partner’s videos is a must – why would you want to refer your subscribers to someone whose channel you wouldn’t watch yourself? – but it can be really hard to get someone with a significantly bigger channel than yours to work with you.

_Will Kitty get to collab with the big dog?_

Larger YouTubers get a lot of collab requests, and they are really busy with their own channels. Even if they love your content, it can be hard to justify taking time away from working on their own channel to do videos that won’t help them grow too.

Collaborating with someone your own size means you both stand to gain equally in channel growth. Instead of approaching someone you love that’s huge, try finding someone you like just as much whose sub count is similar to yours.

There are exceptions to this, of course. The team at **[Mr.Kate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVPcEbVLQgLZX0Rt6jo34A)** managed to work with YouTubers who had millions of subs while they were still under 1 million. They got these high profile collabs because they had something additional to offer that made up for the subscriber gap – they were redesigning the apartments, offices, or studios of the YouTubers they did the collabs with. If you want to work with someone bigger than you, think about what you might be able to offer them in place of new subscribers.

_Mr.Kate makes over **[MyLifeAsEva](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoMPWcQKA%5F9Af5YhWdrZgw?sub%5Fconfirmation=1)**’s bedroom._

Also, try to find someone whose channel has something in common with yours thematically so you know your subscribers will be interested in them. They don’t have to do exactly what you do, but your topics should be related. For example: if you do quirky video game reviews and they do quirky movie reviews, you could team up to review a movie based on a game. That would make sense. But if you quirky video game reviews and they review do very serious ice cream reviews, that’ll make a lot less sense.

A good way to find potentially collab partners is to look at your list of subscribers. You already know everyone there likes your channel!

## 2\. How to contact a partner

Sometimes people leave contact info in their video descriptions, but it might be easier to go to the **About** tab on their channel page and check for an email address. Look for a field that says **for business inquiries**, click on **view email address**, and use the CAPTCHA that appears to prove you aren’t a robot.

Reaching out more casually through Twitter DMs, YouTube comments, or Facebook is good too, but you should use those platforms more to build a relationship that could lead to a collab. If someone had never commented on a video of yours before and then commented once just to ask you to collab it’d be hard to believe they were really interested in your channel.

## 3\. Popular Types of Collab Videos

_[**Gabrielle**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7afFvLLvTiWI97M0jaqgKQ)talks about different types of collabs and how well they work._

In most cases when you do a collab, you’ll each want to have content to post to your own channels (unless you’re doing some type of interview). You don’t want to put a lot of effort into a video that won’t end up being ‘yours’. Here are a few different ways to collaborate:

#### #1\. Shout outs

In this type of collab all you do is mention each other and, usually, use YouTube cards to link to each other’s channels. You make a video that is completely yours, and at some point in it you talk about your partner’s channel and why you like it. To make things fair, you should discuss how long the mentions will be and where in the videos they will happen. It wouldn’t feel good to gush about how great someone is for a full minute near the beginning of your video and have them spend two seconds mentioning you near the end of theirs.

I personally don’t check people out just because someone I like mentions them, so this might not be the best way to go if you’re hoping to bring in new subscribers. It is the easiest kind of collab to do, though.

#### 2\. Guest spots

This is my favorite kind of collab to watch, because each YouTuber has sole creative control over the video that goes on their channel. Instead of trying to blend your styles together, you each make videos that reflect your own personal styles.

For your video, you have the other vlogger on as a guest. In the video you do the same kinds of things your fans like watching you do, and you include the other person. If they’re alright with it, it can be fun to draw them a bit outside their comfort zone. If you like to dance on your channel, and they never dance on theirs, ask them to dance with you!

_**[Matthias](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VX0KXNH20x9MCH3xGjisg)** gets **[NateWantsToBattle](https://www.youtube.com/user/NateWantsToBattle)** – who does song parodies on his channel – to make balloon animals._

Turnabout is fair play, of course, so be prepared to step a bit outside of your own comfort zone when you appear as a guest in one of their videos.

Alternatively, you could just introduce your guest and then let them take over and then do the same thing in reverse on their channel.

#### 3\. Long distance collabs

_**[Lauren](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-S6eBuL9SlwNZTHI6P9Bg)** is in Toronto and **[Aja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiE7g4J3QXBwPUybbRdioQ)** is in LA, but that doesn’t mean they can’t cook together! Also: Lauren’s channel is about food and Aja’s is about healthy living – they aren’t exactly the same, but they’re related enough that the collab makes sense._

Sometimes you really want to work together, but geography just won’t bend to your wills. That doesn’t mean you can’t collab. You can always send each other some footage to cut to and make videos together that way. Or, you can do a Google Hangout or Skype chat and record it.

## 4\. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations

Usually, you have two reasons for wanting to do a collab; having fun with another YouTuber, and growing your channel. The collab exposes you to their subscribers, who will hopefully decide they like you and subscribe to you too. There are ways of increasing the odds of this happening.

Commenting on each other’s videos, and responding to viewer comments, is one of the best. It will help you seem more like a person who is being introduced than a guest star in a video.

For your video, you have the other vlogger on as a guest. In the video you do the same kinds of things your fans like watching you do, and you include the other person. If they’re alright with it, it can be fun to draw them a bit outside their comfort zone. If you like to dance on your channel, and they never dance on theirs, ask them to dance with you!

_**[Matthias](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VX0KXNH20x9MCH3xGjisg)** gets **[NateWantsToBattle](https://www.youtube.com/user/NateWantsToBattle)** – who does song parodies on his channel – to make balloon animals._

Turnabout is fair play, of course, so be prepared to step a bit outside of your own comfort zone when you appear as a guest in one of their videos.

Alternatively, you could just introduce your guest and then let them take over and then do the same thing in reverse on their channel.

#### 3\. Long distance collabs

_**[Lauren](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-S6eBuL9SlwNZTHI6P9Bg)** is in Toronto and **[Aja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiE7g4J3QXBwPUybbRdioQ)** is in LA, but that doesn’t mean they can’t cook together! Also: Lauren’s channel is about food and Aja’s is about healthy living – they aren’t exactly the same, but they’re related enough that the collab makes sense._

Sometimes you really want to work together, but geography just won’t bend to your wills. That doesn’t mean you can’t collab. You can always send each other some footage to cut to and make videos together that way. Or, you can do a Google Hangout or Skype chat and record it.

## 4\. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations

Usually, you have two reasons for wanting to do a collab; having fun with another YouTuber, and growing your channel. The collab exposes you to their subscribers, who will hopefully decide they like you and subscribe to you too. There are ways of increasing the odds of this happening.

Commenting on each other’s videos, and responding to viewer comments, is one of the best. It will help you seem more like a person who is being introduced than a guest star in a video.

## 1\. Choosing A Potential Partner

Before you think about how you’re going to approach someone you need to decide who you want to approach.

A lot of people automatically want to approach their YouTube hero, and that can be a mistake. Liking your partner’s videos is a must – why would you want to refer your subscribers to someone whose channel you wouldn’t watch yourself? – but it can be really hard to get someone with a significantly bigger channel than yours to work with you.

![ Choosing A Potential Partner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-potential-collab-partner.jpg)

_Will Kitty get to collab with the big dog?_

Larger YouTubers get a lot of collab requests, and they are really busy with their own channels. Even if they love your content, it can be hard to justify taking time away from working on their own channel to do videos that won’t help them grow too.

Collaborating with someone your own size means you both stand to gain equally in channel growth. Instead of approaching someone you love that’s huge, try finding someone you like just as much whose sub count is similar to yours.

There are exceptions to this, of course. The team at **[Mr.Kate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVPcEbVLQgLZX0Rt6jo34A)** managed to work with YouTubers who had millions of subs while they were still under 1 million. They got these high profile collabs because they had something additional to offer that made up for the subscriber gap – they were redesigning the apartments, offices, or studios of the YouTubers they did the collabs with. If you want to work with someone bigger than you, think about what you might be able to offer them in place of new subscribers.

_Mr.Kate makes over **[MyLifeAsEva](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoMPWcQKA%5F9Af5YhWdrZgw?sub%5Fconfirmation=1)**’s bedroom._

Also, try to find someone whose channel has something in common with yours thematically so you know your subscribers will be interested in them. They don’t have to do exactly what you do, but your topics should be related. For example: if you do quirky video game reviews and they do quirky movie reviews, you could team up to review a movie based on a game. That would make sense. But if you quirky video game reviews and they review do very serious ice cream reviews, that’ll make a lot less sense.

A good way to find potentially collab partners is to look at your list of subscribers. You already know everyone there likes your channel!

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. How to contact a partner

Sometimes people leave contact info in their video descriptions, but it might be easier to go to the **About** tab on their channel page and check for an email address. Look for a field that says **for business inquiries**, click on **view email address**, and use the CAPTCHA that appears to prove you aren’t a robot.

Reaching out more casually through Twitter DMs, YouTube comments, or Facebook is good too, but you should use those platforms more to build a relationship that could lead to a collab. If someone had never commented on a video of yours before and then commented once just to ask you to collab it’d be hard to believe they were really interested in your channel.

## 3\. Popular Types of Collab Videos

_[**Gabrielle**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7afFvLLvTiWI97M0jaqgKQ)talks about different types of collabs and how well they work._

In most cases when you do a collab, you’ll each want to have content to post to your own channels (unless you’re doing some type of interview). You don’t want to put a lot of effort into a video that won’t end up being ‘yours’. Here are a few different ways to collaborate:

#### #1\. Shout outs

In this type of collab all you do is mention each other and, usually, use YouTube cards to link to each other’s channels. You make a video that is completely yours, and at some point in it you talk about your partner’s channel and why you like it. To make things fair, you should discuss how long the mentions will be and where in the videos they will happen. It wouldn’t feel good to gush about how great someone is for a full minute near the beginning of your video and have them spend two seconds mentioning you near the end of theirs.

I personally don’t check people out just because someone I like mentions them, so this might not be the best way to go if you’re hoping to bring in new subscribers. It is the easiest kind of collab to do, though.

#### 2\. Guest spots

This is my favorite kind of collab to watch, because each YouTuber has sole creative control over the video that goes on their channel. Instead of trying to blend your styles together, you each make videos that reflect your own personal styles.

For your video, you have the other vlogger on as a guest. In the video you do the same kinds of things your fans like watching you do, and you include the other person. If they’re alright with it, it can be fun to draw them a bit outside their comfort zone. If you like to dance on your channel, and they never dance on theirs, ask them to dance with you!

_**[Matthias](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VX0KXNH20x9MCH3xGjisg)** gets **[NateWantsToBattle](https://www.youtube.com/user/NateWantsToBattle)** – who does song parodies on his channel – to make balloon animals._

Turnabout is fair play, of course, so be prepared to step a bit outside of your own comfort zone when you appear as a guest in one of their videos.

Alternatively, you could just introduce your guest and then let them take over and then do the same thing in reverse on their channel.

#### 3\. Long distance collabs

_**[Lauren](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-S6eBuL9SlwNZTHI6P9Bg)** is in Toronto and **[Aja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiE7g4J3QXBwPUybbRdioQ)** is in LA, but that doesn’t mean they can’t cook together! Also: Lauren’s channel is about food and Aja’s is about healthy living – they aren’t exactly the same, but they’re related enough that the collab makes sense._

Sometimes you really want to work together, but geography just won’t bend to your wills. That doesn’t mean you can’t collab. You can always send each other some footage to cut to and make videos together that way. Or, you can do a Google Hangout or Skype chat and record it.

## 4\. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations

Usually, you have two reasons for wanting to do a collab; having fun with another YouTuber, and growing your channel. The collab exposes you to their subscribers, who will hopefully decide they like you and subscribe to you too. There are ways of increasing the odds of this happening.

### Steps to Check YouTube Channel Monetization on the Channel's Homepage

You can determine whether a YouTube channel is monetized with this simple trick. Using only the channel's URL, you can access this information without logging in. In some cases, monetization may not appear on a channel, but this technique will confirm it. Here's how:

#### Step 1\. Visit the Channel's homepage

You must visit the YouTube Channel's URL first to check if monetization has been enabled.

![channel’s homepage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-check-if-your-youtube-channel-is-monetized-correctly-1.JPG)

#### Step 2\. View the monetization status

* Click thе "Viеw Pagе Sourcе" option from thе YouTube Channеl's homеpagе.
* You can do this by prеssing thе kеyboard shortcut "Ctrl + F".
* Entеr "is\_monеtization\_еnablеd" into thе pop-up window.
* As a result, the pagе's tеxt will be highlighted.
* Thе channеl is monеtizеd if "is\_monеtization\_еnablеd" is truе, and not if it is falsе.

* Log in to YouTube Studio by clicking on the option. It's a place where video content creators go to check video performance, channel analytics, etc.
* The next step is to go to the content tab in YouTube studio, . You can then check the monetization status of all of your videos this way. From the left-hand menu, select the corresponding content tab item.

![monetization status](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-check-if-your-youtube-channel-is-monetized-correctly-3.jpg)

### Analyzing common monetization indicators

#### 1.Ads on Your Videos

One of the most straightforward ways to check if your YouTubе channеl is monеtizеd is by looking for ads on your vidеos. Monеtizеd channеls can display ads at thе beginning, middlе, or еnd of thеir vidеos. Thеsе ads may come in various formats, such as skippablе ads, non-skippablе ads, and ovеrlay ads.

To check for ads on your vidеos, watch some of your own content. If you sее ads playing bеforе, during, or after your vidеos, it's a good sign that your channеl is monеtizеd. Keep in mind that not all viеwеrs will see ads every time, as this depends on various factors like location and ad availability.

#### 2\. Sponsorships and Paid Promotions

Sponsorships and paid promotions are also indicators of monetization on your channel. Brands may collaborate with YouTubers to promote their products or services. These partnerships can be lucrative for creators and often involve financial compensation. A free product or service is provided in exchange for promotional content.

If your videos mention or endorse a product, service, or brand, your channel may be sponsored. Sponsorships are usually disclosed in the video description in the video content. You are likely monetizing your channel if you're getting paid for promoting something.

#### 3\. Merchandise Links in Descriptions

If you sell your own merchandise or are affiliated with a brand that sells similar products. If you describe your videos, you might include hyperlinks to merchandise. Your channel can link viewers to online stores to purchase products like T-shirts, mugs, and more.

Check your video descriptions for any merchandise links. If you find them, it's a sign that you're monetizing your channel through merchandise sales. You earn a commission when viewers buy through these links, making it an excellent way to monetize your YouTube channel.

#### 4\. Channel Memberships

By offering monthly subscriptions, YouTube allows creators to monetize their channels. You can invite subscribers to join your channel as members. They'll get members-only content, custom badges, emojis, and more. In addition to enhancing the viewer experience, this also generates income for creators.

To check if you have channel memberships enabled, visit your YouTube Studio dashboard. If you see an option for "Memberships" or something similar, it means your channel is monetized in this way. Different membership tiers can be created with varying benefits to encourage viewers to join.

![indicators for monetization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-check-if-your-youtube-channel-is-monetized-correctly-4.jpg)

#### 5\. Super Chat

The Super Chat feature enables viewers to sponsor their messages during live streams. Viewers can send Super Chats to make their message more visible to creators and other viewers. By purchasing Super Chats, creators earn money.

To see if you have Super Chat enabled, go to your YouTube Live dashboard. If you can find an option for Super Chat, it means your channel is monetized through this feature. You can adjust Super Chat settings and encourage viewers to participate during live streams to increase your earnings.
