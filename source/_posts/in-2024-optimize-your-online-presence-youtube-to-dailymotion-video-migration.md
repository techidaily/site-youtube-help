It is significant for a business to stay connected to its customers and videos are a wonderful medium to build that connect! Dailymotion gives you a golden opportunity and platform to share your videos on websites other than YouTube. This means that you can transfer your videos from YouTube to dailymotion in few minutes and increase the audience. There is no direct transfer feature in YouTube and hence this post will help in guiding how can you transfer the video content from YouTube to Dailymotion!

* [Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion](#part1)
* [Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion](#part2)

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion

This one is little longer but many people vote for it as a safer one! All you have to do is to login to your YouTube official account and download all the videos that you have uploaded in MP4 format by clicking on Edit option appearing at right of the video.

Ready to learn [How to Download YouTube Videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . It's easy, fun and a great way to share your movies with the world.

Save it to the desired folder on your PC and navigate to the Dailymotion account page. Sign in with your credentials and click on upload video. Browse the video from the location where you saved, give it a title and description.

![dailymotion-uploading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dailymotion-uploading.jpg)

Next, click on channel drop-down menu and choose a category which best describes your video. Besides this, you would see a ‘Tags’ text box. You can add one or more tags (maximum 10) and select the privacy options as per your requirement. Tags act as a criterion for SEO optimization and help people in finding your video. Finally, just click on save to upload the video on dailymotion.

## Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion

You can do this by liaising with Freedom MCN Network as it allows you to grow faster on Dailymotion. All you have to do is to search for ‘dashboard.tm’ on Google and sign in using you email and password. It will direct you to Dailymotion page; you can also opt to sign in with your Facebook credentials. When you will press enter and login, the first screen only will show the prompt if you want to synch YouTube and Dailymotion channels? Since, our answer is yes, the screen will ask you to login into your YouTube account and the screen will navigate you to the login into Google account linked to your YouTube account. Just like in all apps, you have to allow Freedom to access the data from your YouTube account. The next screen will list down number of videos that have been uploaded to your YouTube Account and the ones which are already synched with Dailymotion will have a check against their name. The ones which are not synched will have a box; you can simply check it and click on ‘Synch videos’ at the top right corner.

![ Sync Dailymotion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-dailymotion-video.jpg)

It will ask for your email address to get notifications, put in your email ID and click on Sync. Once they are active and synched you will receive a notification on your email with a subject ‘Done reuploading’ followed by the tile of the video. This simply means that you need not upload any video separately on dailymotion, you can simply synch it with YouTube and put in your efforts of uploading only once!

The **video thumbnails** you use for YouTube are vital to getting views and subscribers. There are a lot of things that go into making people watch your videos, but your video thumbnail might be the most important factor.

Here are 5 easy tips for creating thumbnails that get views.

1. **[Have a Consistent Layout](#one)**
2. **[Use Your Face](#two)**
3. **[Use Graphics/Emojis That is On Topic](#three)**
4. **[Make Your Text Huge](#four)**
5. **[Keep It Clutter-Free!](#five)**

## Edit Your Videos Before Creating Video Thumbnails

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## 1\. Have a Consistent Layout

Your thumbnails all must look like part of the same set. You want viewers to recognize your videos like yours, and they are more likely to do that if you build up a standard layout that they can start associating with you.

An example of a standard layout could be you in the middle of the screen wearing an expression that matches the theme of your video, with your title written underneath your face. Every individual thumbnail would still be different, but you and the text would always be in the same spot.

![Consistent Layout](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consistent-layout.jpg)

## **2\. Use Your Face**

People feel automatically connected and drawn into images that make eye contact. This makes thumbnails which feature faces more click-able than thumbnails which don’t, in most genres (i.e. if you make food videos then this may not apply – featuring the food might be more important than featuring your face). [Check out more tips like this here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Also, if somebody recognizes you in your thumbnail from a previous video of yours, that will go a long way towards making them click.

## 3\. Use Graphics/Emojis that are On Topic

Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail. To make your thumbnails look polished, consider using small images (like emojis or hearts) to stand out. This will add color and personality to your thumbnail.

Make sure the images you choose are relevant to the topic of your video.

## 4\. Make Your Text Huge

If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.

Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.

## 5\. Keep it Clutter-Free

It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much. You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.

A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words. That way they won’t clutter your screen, and you can make them large enough to read on small-screened devices.

## 5\. Keep it Clutter-Free

It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much. You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.

A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words. That way they won’t clutter your screen, and you can make them large enough to read on small-screened devices.
