Let's take a look at the YouTube Money Calculator now and explore your potential for generating income from your passion for YouTube.

## Part 1: What's a CPM and How Do YouTube Money Calculators Average It Out?

CPM stands for ‘cost per mille/thousand’ and is the price of a thousand ad impressions (to the advertiser. For the creator, this is the amount of money they make per thousand ad impressions).

YouTube calculators will never be able to know the CPM for a YouTube channel as the rates vary for different channels and different ads. Disclosing your CPM is against the rules, so there’s not a lot of information out there to go on.

However, by taking an average of some of the current CPM rates from advertisers on YouTube, calculators are able to average out what a YouTube channel could be making. Keep in mind that, usually, the numbers that they use can be a bit on the high side compared to actual earnings. At times, though, these calculators can be very close.

## Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator

The YouTube Money Calculator is a free calculator tool that allows you to estimate the money obtained from any YouTube video. Calculations are entirely based on the number of views and an average CPM of $2 - $5\. A user just needs to insert the total number of video views that they think they can get or that another channel has to discover how much a person could earn or be earning.

If you don't know your CPM yet, don't worry because our tool can give you an estimated revenue calculation based on a commonly accepted range of CPM figures for your views. Using this number, the YouTube Money Calculator can give you potential revenue by video as well as by channel on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. Let's take a look:

* [1\. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos](#videos)
* [2\. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Channel](#channel)

### 1\. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos

To use YouTube Money Calculator to get an estimated calculation of your revenue for a single video, simply set the number of views you get per day (or hope to get) and the CPM rates. If you don't know your CPM, the tool will automatically select a typical range based on the number of views.

From here you can start to play around and see what the impact could be of a different number of views and different CPM range. Do keep in mind that these figures are estimated, and there are many factors that come into play to determine your final CPM rate.

If you want to go deeper into your research and discover how much revenue a specific video could make, you can simply paste in the URL of the video you want to investigate, and the YouTube Money Calculator will show you the results. These will be presented as the number of total video views as well as the estimated earnings for that video based on typical CPM rates, making it a great resource to establish whether to monetize a video or not.

### 2\. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Channel

If you'd like a more complete view of your YouTube earnings potential, why not investigate the revenue possibilities for the whole channel? Simply paste your channel link into the box and our tool will estimate how much you could be earning if you monetize that channel.

As well as showing this, the tool will show all sorts of other useful information such as number of total views, number of subscribers, number of uploaded videos and even your country and category. It's a great place to start to evaluate your efforts and to get a realistic idea of what your earnings could be.

## Part 3: Free YouTube Money Calculator Alternatives

Some of the best YouTube Money Calculator alternatives available are:

* [**Social Blade**](#social)
* [**Influencer Marketing Hub**](#influencer)

### 1. How Social Blade Calculates YouTube Money

Social Blade delivers a calculation based on a CPM rate between .25 cents and $4 USD. Users need only type in the name of the channel they are interested in and Social Blade will deliver all kinds of information about that channel, like how many subscribers and views it received in the last 30 days. It will also include estimates of monthly and yearly earnings. The revenue results are adjusted based off of the overall size of the channel and the total number of views that they receive each day. You can even scroll down for estimates of daily earnings listed by date.

### 2. How Influencer Marketing Hub Calculates YouTube Money

Influencer Marketing Hub is almost like an active infographic that allows a user to very quickly adjust sliders based on the daily video views, active engagement, views per month, and views per year.

## Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?

YouTube partner money is calculated using something called the CPM. Your CPM, if you're new to YouTube and partner advertising, is likely to be quite low, but can be built up over time.

CPM is actually a term for advertisers rather than content creators, as it denotes the amount an advertiser pays to serve its ad to 1,000 views of a video. What you really want to know is your RPM, or revenue per thousand, which is about how much you'll get paid for 1,000 views of that ad. In the YouTube world, they call this number eCPM which stands for effective CPM, and if you have access to YouTube analytics, you'll be able to find it under the estimated monetized playbacks metric.

If you don't have YouTube Analytics, you can estimate your eCPM by dividing your most recent earnings by the number of monetized views and then multiplying by 1,000\. For example, if you got 10,000 views of a video and earned $30, then your CPM would be $3.

There are a number of factors that affect what your CPM is, including what category it's in, what the season is (e.g. Christmas, Halloween), what language you speak, which country you're from, how much competition there is and much more. As an average, most advertisers are paying in the region of $7.60 per 1,000 impressions, although this can be as high as $15 or as low as $0.10.

But that's not the whole story.

Of course, YouTube needs to make money too, so don't expect to see all of that $7.60 popped into your AdSense account. Google keeps 45 percent of all YouTube advertising revenue, so you'll get the other 55 per cent. If you were earning that average $7.60, your actual earnings would be $4.18 per 1,000 views.

As your subscriber numbers rise and your daily views rise, so will your CPM, so don't get disheartened if you've discovered you're on $2 or worse. Keep plugging away and building your fan base, and you'll get there in the end.

It's important to realize that, for most new channels, they'll need to post videos for around two years before they start earning anything significant. If you're just getting started on YouTube, find your niche and make sure it's one that advertisers care about. Get it right, and you'll have a highly targeted audience base which advertisers are willing to pay good money to use.

## Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform

If you've had a go with the YouTube money calculator and are excited about the potential to make money from YouTube, the next thing you'll need to do is to sign up for the partner program. Here's how:

         * **Find out if you qualify**: You'll need to be 18 or over and to have had at least 4,000 views on your channel and 1,000 subscribers in the past 12 months
         * **Enable monetization on your account**: Sign in, select 'creator studio', then go to Channel > Status features. Look for the tab for Monetization and click to enable.
         * **Agree to the terms**: Once you've read and agreed to them, click accept
         * **Choose monetizing options**: Pick from overlay in the video, TrueView in-stream ads or video contains product placement. You can always change this later.
         * **Confirm enrolment**: Click 'monetize my videos' to confirm enrolment

Once you've done all that, YouTube will review your application and decide if you can join the program. Usually, this happens within a matter of seconds, generating confirmation via email. Your account will now have 'Partner Verified' on it, and your chosen ads will start being displayed immediately.

## Part 6: Making Money on YouTube

We've all been seduced by the big hitters on YouTube, from PewDiePie to Lilly Singh, and have imagined that we'll be the next YouTube millionaire. However, the reality is that 99 per cent of those on YouTube are earning peanuts for the effort they put into their channels from these advertising streams.

However, there are other ways to make money on YouTube. It makes sense not to put all your eggs in one basket, so alongside ads and growing your fanbase, we've come up with a number of other ways to [monetize your YouTube channel](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [estimate how much your video can make.](https://www.influenex.com/)

Let's take a look at the YouTube Money Calculator now and explore your potential for generating income from your passion for YouTube.

## Part 1: What's a CPM and How Do YouTube Money Calculators Average It Out?

CPM stands for ‘cost per mille/thousand’ and is the price of a thousand ad impressions (to the advertiser. For the creator, this is the amount of money they make per thousand ad impressions).

YouTube calculators will never be able to know the CPM for a YouTube channel as the rates vary for different channels and different ads. Disclosing your CPM is against the rules, so there’s not a lot of information out there to go on.

However, by taking an average of some of the current CPM rates from advertisers on YouTube, calculators are able to average out what a YouTube channel could be making. Keep in mind that, usually, the numbers that they use can be a bit on the high side compared to actual earnings. At times, though, these calculators can be very close.

## Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator

The YouTube Money Calculator is a free calculator tool that allows you to estimate the money obtained from any YouTube video. Calculations are entirely based on the number of views and an average CPM of $2 - $5\. A user just needs to insert the total number of video views that they think they can get or that another channel has to discover how much a person could earn or be earning.

If you don't know your CPM yet, don't worry because our tool can give you an estimated revenue calculation based on a commonly accepted range of CPM figures for your views. Using this number, the YouTube Money Calculator can give you potential revenue by video as well as by channel on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. Let's take a look:

* [1\. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos](#videos)
* [2\. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Channel](#channel)

### 1\. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos

To use YouTube Money Calculator to get an estimated calculation of your revenue for a single video, simply set the number of views you get per day (or hope to get) and the CPM rates. If you don't know your CPM, the tool will automatically select a typical range based on the number of views.

From here you can start to play around and see what the impact could be of a different number of views and different CPM range. Do keep in mind that these figures are estimated, and there are many factors that come into play to determine your final CPM rate.

If you want to go deeper into your research and discover how much revenue a specific video could make, you can simply paste in the URL of the video you want to investigate, and the YouTube Money Calculator will show you the results. These will be presented as the number of total video views as well as the estimated earnings for that video based on typical CPM rates, making it a great resource to establish whether to monetize a video or not.

### 2\. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Channel

If you'd like a more complete view of your YouTube earnings potential, why not investigate the revenue possibilities for the whole channel? Simply paste your channel link into the box and our tool will estimate how much you could be earning if you monetize that channel.

As well as showing this, the tool will show all sorts of other useful information such as number of total views, number of subscribers, number of uploaded videos and even your country and category. It's a great place to start to evaluate your efforts and to get a realistic idea of what your earnings could be.

## Part 3: Free YouTube Money Calculator Alternatives

Some of the best YouTube Money Calculator alternatives available are:

* [**Social Blade**](#social)
* [**Influencer Marketing Hub**](#influencer)

### 1. How Social Blade Calculates YouTube Money

Social Blade delivers a calculation based on a CPM rate between .25 cents and $4 USD. Users need only type in the name of the channel they are interested in and Social Blade will deliver all kinds of information about that channel, like how many subscribers and views it received in the last 30 days. It will also include estimates of monthly and yearly earnings. The revenue results are adjusted based off of the overall size of the channel and the total number of views that they receive each day. You can even scroll down for estimates of daily earnings listed by date.

### 2. How Influencer Marketing Hub Calculates YouTube Money

Influencer Marketing Hub is almost like an active infographic that allows a user to very quickly adjust sliders based on the daily video views, active engagement, views per month, and views per year.

## Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?

YouTube partner money is calculated using something called the CPM. Your CPM, if you're new to YouTube and partner advertising, is likely to be quite low, but can be built up over time.

CPM is actually a term for advertisers rather than content creators, as it denotes the amount an advertiser pays to serve its ad to 1,000 views of a video. What you really want to know is your RPM, or revenue per thousand, which is about how much you'll get paid for 1,000 views of that ad. In the YouTube world, they call this number eCPM which stands for effective CPM, and if you have access to YouTube analytics, you'll be able to find it under the estimated monetized playbacks metric.

If you don't have YouTube Analytics, you can estimate your eCPM by dividing your most recent earnings by the number of monetized views and then multiplying by 1,000\. For example, if you got 10,000 views of a video and earned $30, then your CPM would be $3.

There are a number of factors that affect what your CPM is, including what category it's in, what the season is (e.g. Christmas, Halloween), what language you speak, which country you're from, how much competition there is and much more. As an average, most advertisers are paying in the region of $7.60 per 1,000 impressions, although this can be as high as $15 or as low as $0.10.

But that's not the whole story.

Of course, YouTube needs to make money too, so don't expect to see all of that $7.60 popped into your AdSense account. Google keeps 45 percent of all YouTube advertising revenue, so you'll get the other 55 per cent. If you were earning that average $7.60, your actual earnings would be $4.18 per 1,000 views.

As your subscriber numbers rise and your daily views rise, so will your CPM, so don't get disheartened if you've discovered you're on $2 or worse. Keep plugging away and building your fan base, and you'll get there in the end.

It's important to realize that, for most new channels, they'll need to post videos for around two years before they start earning anything significant. If you're just getting started on YouTube, find your niche and make sure it's one that advertisers care about. Get it right, and you'll have a highly targeted audience base which advertisers are willing to pay good money to use.

## Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform

If you've had a go with the YouTube money calculator and are excited about the potential to make money from YouTube, the next thing you'll need to do is to sign up for the partner program. Here's how:

         * **Find out if you qualify**: You'll need to be 18 or over and to have had at least 4,000 views on your channel and 1,000 subscribers in the past 12 months
         * **Enable monetization on your account**: Sign in, select 'creator studio', then go to Channel > Status features. Look for the tab for Monetization and click to enable.
         * **Agree to the terms**: Once you've read and agreed to them, click accept
         * **Choose monetizing options**: Pick from overlay in the video, TrueView in-stream ads or video contains product placement. You can always change this later.
         * **Confirm enrolment**: Click 'monetize my videos' to confirm enrolment

Once you've done all that, YouTube will review your application and decide if you can join the program. Usually, this happens within a matter of seconds, generating confirmation via email. Your account will now have 'Partner Verified' on it, and your chosen ads will start being displayed immediately.

## Part 6: Making Money on YouTube

We've all been seduced by the big hitters on YouTube, from PewDiePie to Lilly Singh, and have imagined that we'll be the next YouTube millionaire. However, the reality is that 99 per cent of those on YouTube are earning peanuts for the effort they put into their channels from these advertising streams.

However, there are other ways to make money on YouTube. It makes sense not to put all your eggs in one basket, so alongside ads and growing your fanbase, we've come up with a number of other ways to [monetize your YouTube channel](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [estimate how much your video can make.](https://www.influenex.com/)

Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5S’ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There's very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |

The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 has a DIGIC 7 image processor and a 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor that lets you extend the ISO value to 51200 and shoot your vlogs even under low light conditions.

| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png)       | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn't provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600\. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D's 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png)       | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn't provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600\. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D's 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| ![Canon M50](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png)        | Best mid-range mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The EOS M50 has been on the market for just a few months and it is already regarded as one of the best mirrorless cameras for vlogging. Its 24.1 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 Image Processor are improved versions of those in the Canon EOS M100 model. With the Canon EOS M50, you can crank up the ISO sensitivity to 51200.

| ![Panasonic GH5S](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-2.png)   | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S The Panasonic's GH series was made famous by the LUMIX DMC-GH4 model that will be remembered as the world's first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera to offer the 4K video recording option. That's why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera's 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5S’ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There's very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |

| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png)       | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn't provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600\. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D's 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| ![Canon M50](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png)        | Best mid-range mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The EOS M50 has been on the market for just a few months and it is already regarded as one of the best mirrorless cameras for vlogging. Its 24.1 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 Image Processor are improved versions of those in the Canon EOS M100 model. With the Canon EOS M50, you can crank up the ISO sensitivity to 51200.

| ![Panasonic GH5S](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-2.png)   | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S The Panasonic's GH series was made famous by the LUMIX DMC-GH4 model that will be remembered as the world's first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera to offer the 4K video recording option. That's why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera's 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5S’ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There's very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |

The SL2 also has a microphone jack you can connect an external microphone too for better audio.  **PROS** _\- Microphone jack_ _\- Wi-Fi connectivity_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video support_ _\- Optical image stabilizer could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png)       | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn't provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600\. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D's 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
