Be it YouTube or any other streaming channel, or even for selling your videos on any e-commerce website, intros play a vital role in your brand promotion, and creating them is not as complicated as it sounds either.

The following sections describe in detail **how to make a YouTube intro** with Wondershare Filmora video editor, and keep it safe so it can be re-used easily in all your creations to maintain consistency and to give your brand a unique identity.

## Part 1: How to Make a YouTube Intro Video with Filmora

With Wondershare Filmora, you can create your custom intros from scratch, i.e., even if you don’t have an existing image or footage to start with. You can follow the method given below to learn **how to make YouTube intro** with Filmora:

### Step 1: Add Intro Background to Filmora

Launch Wondershare Filmora, go to **Media** tab at the top, select the **Sample Colors** category from the left pane.

Notice all the existing solid and gradient colors in the **Media** library in the right, hover the mouse over the tile of the color you want to use as a background, and click the **+** icon that appears in the center to add it to the timeline.

![use sample colors as intro background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sample-colors-media-in-filmora9.jpg)

**Note:** The default duration of such solids is 5 seconds. You can increase or decrease this time by dragging the right handle of track in the timeline.

Alternatively, you can also use your own background image or video clip by selecting the **Project Media** category from the left pane, clicking anywhere inside the **Media** window, and then importing your favorite media file to Filmora. After importing, you can follow the procedure given above to add it to the timeline.

### Step 2: Select and Add Audio/Sound Effect to YouTube Intro

With audio in the YouTube intro, your video will be more recognizable. If you have watched PewDiePie ‘s video, you’ll find that even though he changed the images on the intro often, he keeps the music and sound the same in the intro.

In Filmora, you can use the music and sound effect in the inbuilt audio library, double click the audio thumbnail from the library to listen to the soundtrack.

Repeat the process until you find the background music or sound effect that you can use in the intro. Once found, drag and drop it to the audio track below the video.

Be it YouTube or any other streaming channel, or even for selling your videos on any e-commerce website, intros play a vital role in your brand promotion, and creating them is not as complicated as it sounds either.

The following sections describe in detail **how to make a YouTube intro** with Wondershare Filmora video editor, and keep it safe so it can be re-used easily in all your creations to maintain consistency and to give your brand a unique identity.

## Part 1: How to Make a YouTube Intro Video with Filmora

With Wondershare Filmora, you can create your custom intros from scratch, i.e., even if you don’t have an existing image or footage to start with. You can follow the method given below to learn **how to make YouTube intro** with Filmora:

### Step 1: Add Intro Background to Filmora

Launch Wondershare Filmora, go to **Media** tab at the top, select the **Sample Colors** category from the left pane.

Notice all the existing solid and gradient colors in the **Media** library in the right, hover the mouse over the tile of the color you want to use as a background, and click the **+** icon that appears in the center to add it to the timeline.

![use sample colors as intro background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sample-colors-media-in-filmora9.jpg)

**Note:** The default duration of such solids is 5 seconds. You can increase or decrease this time by dragging the right handle of track in the timeline.

After importing, you can follow the procedure given above to add it to the timeline.

### Step 2: Select and Add Audio/Sound Effect to YouTube Intro

With audio in the YouTube intro, your video will be more recognizable. If you have watched PewDiePie ‘s video, you’ll find that even though he changed the images on the intro often, he keeps the music and sound the same in the intro.
