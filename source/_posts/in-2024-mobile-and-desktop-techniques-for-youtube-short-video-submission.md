[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Quite recently, YouTube launched Shorts to compete with Tik Tok. At the time of this writing, the users in India have access to the fully functional version of the app. Although YouTube Shorts is available for both Android and iOS platforms, its functions are limited as the application is still in its Beta phase for the remaining part of the globe.

With that said, the following sections explain the step-by-step process on **how to upload a short video on YouTube** Shorts both from your smartphone and a PC.

## Part 1: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube from PC?

The fact is, if you are using a computer to upload short videos to YouTube, the process is identical to publishing your other, regular footage. However, there are a few guidelines that your clips must comply with so that the streaming platform could specifically identify them as YouTube Shorts. These norms include:

* Your videos must not be more than 60 seconds long in duration
* They must be shot in portrait orientation, ideally in the 9:16 aspect ratio
* The title or the description must contain ‘#Shorts’ (without quotes) in it

Once you have a video recorded using the first two guidelines from the above list, you can use the instructions given below to upload the media on YouTube:

#### Step 1: Select a Short Video to Upload

![Upload YouTube Shorts Video to desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-short-videos-on-youtube-pc.jpg)

Launch your favorite web browser on your PC, go to YouTube, make sure to sign in to your YouTube account, click the **Create** (**Camera**) icon from the top-right corner of the web page, click **SELECT FILES** on the **Upload videos** window, and locate, select, and upload a short video from your PC to the portal.

![Upload YouTube Shorts Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-short-videos-interface-on-youtube-pc.jpg)

#### Step 2: Mark the Video as Short

On the **Details** window that appears, add **#Shorts** in the **Title** or **Description** field, optionally pick a thumbnail from the suggested images present under the **Thumbnail** section (or upload a custom picture from your PC), select your preferred radio button from under the **Audience** section, make the other necessary changes if need be, and click **NEXT**. When the **Video elements** window comes up, choose your preferred options and elements, click **NEXT**.

![Mark YouTube Shorts Video in title and description](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mark-shorts-videos-on-youtube-pc.jpg)

#### Step 3: Publish the Short Video

On the **Visibility** window, choose your preferred radio button from under the **Save or publish** section or select **Schedule** to set a different time when the short video should be published automatically. Finally, click **SAVE** to publish the clip as a short video on YouTube from your computer.

![post YouTube Shorts Video  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/publish-youtube-shorts-video-desktop.jpg)

To sum up, uploading YouTube Shorts video from desktop has nothing different from uploading regular YouTube video besides the requirements listed at the beginning of this article.

## Part 2: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube Mobile App?

The process of **uploading YouTube Shorts** from the mobile app is fairly simple compared to the method used on a computer. While using the app, you can either upload an existing video or shoot a new one from within the program itself then and there, add music and text, and upload it right away. Both these methods are explained below in detail:

**Note:** The guidelines for creating and uploading short videos to YouTube remain the same, regardless of the platform or device you use.

### Method 1: Upload an Existing Short Video

**Note:** Make sure to have the target video on the smartphone and that you have downloaded, installed, and signed in to the YouTube app before proceeding.

#### Step 1: Select a Video to Upload

![Select a Video to Upload as Shorts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-shorts-videos-to-upload-on-youtube.jpg)

On your Android or iOS smartphone, launch the YouTube app, tap the **+** (**Create**) icon from the bottom, tap **Create a Short** from the **Create** box that pops up from the bottom, tap **Upload** from the bottom-right corner of the next screen, and select and upload a short, 60 seconds video recorded in portrait orientation from your device’s storage to the app.

#### Step 2: Add Details

![add details to Shorts video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-details-to-youtube-shrots-video.jpg)

On the next screen, tap **NEXT**, user the **Music** and **Text** icons at the bottom-left corner to add a background music and caption to the video respectively, and tap **NEXT** from the top-right corner. On the next screen, enter a name for the video in the **Title** field along with the **#Shorts** tag, and tap **Select audience** to choose your preferred audience.

#### Step 3: Upload the Video

Finally tap **UPLOAD** from the top-right corner to upload the short video on YouTube.

### Method 2: Record a Short Video and Upload

**Step 1:** Record Shorts Video

Previously, I have introduced [how to record and upload YouTube Shorts videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), so I will keep the content concise here.

Please note you will not see the **Create a Short** option if you are outsides of India.

In the YouTube app, tap the **+** (**Add**) button and select **Create** **a Short**. Please note you will not see the **Create a Short** option if you are outsides of India.

Next, use the **Speed** and **Timer** icons to set the speed of the video and the countdown timer duration before the app starts recording the video when you press the **Record** button respectively.

Now tap the **Record** button from the bottom to start recording a video and stop to stop the recording. Make sure to shoot the footage in the portrait mode (ideally in the 9:16 aspect ratio). Tap **NEXT** from the bottom-right corner to proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Add Text and Music to the Short Video**

On the next window, use the **Music** and **Text** buttons from the bottom-left corner to add a background music and caption to the video, and tap **NEXT** from the top-right corner.

**Step 3:** **Upload and Post the Short Video**

**Conclusion**

Learning the process of **how to post short videos on YouTube** is fairly simple as long as you have the video recorded in the portrait orientation, it is up to 60 seconds long, and contains the ‘#Shorts’ tag (without quotes) in the title or description.

## Part 2: How to Upload Short Video on YouTube Mobile App?

The process of **uploading YouTube Shorts** from the mobile app is fairly simple compared to the method used on a computer. While using the app, you can either upload an existing video or shoot a new one from within the program itself then and there, add music and text, and upload it right away. Both these methods are explained below in detail:

**Note:** The guidelines for creating and uploading short videos to YouTube remain the same, regardless of the platform or device you use.

### Method 1: Upload an Existing Short Video

**Note:** Make sure to have the target video on the smartphone and that you have downloaded, installed, and signed in to the YouTube app before proceeding.

#### Step 1: Select a Video to Upload

![Select a Video to Upload as Shorts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-shorts-videos-to-upload-on-youtube.jpg)

On your Android or iOS smartphone, launch the YouTube app, tap the **+** (**Create**) icon from the bottom, tap **Create a Short** from the **Create** box that pops up from the bottom, tap **Upload** from the bottom-right corner of the next screen, and select and upload a short, 60 seconds video recorded in portrait orientation from your device’s storage to the app.

#### Step 2: Add Details

![add details to Shorts video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-details-to-youtube-shrots-video.jpg)

On the next screen, tap **NEXT**, user the **Music** and **Text** icons at the bottom-left corner to add a background music and caption to the video respectively, and tap **NEXT** from the top-right corner. On the next screen, enter a name for the video in the **Title** field along with the **#Shorts** tag, and tap **Select audience** to choose your preferred audience.

#### Step 3: Upload the Video

Finally tap **UPLOAD** from the top-right corner to upload the short video on YouTube.

### Method 2: Record a Short Video and Upload

**Step 1:** Record Shorts Video

Previously, I have introduced [how to record and upload YouTube Shorts videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), so I will keep the content concise here.

Please note you will not see the **Create a Short** option if you are outsides of India.

![ Record YouTube Shorts video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-create-youtube-short-video-mobile.jpg)

In the YouTube app, tap the **+** (**Add**) button and select **Create** **a Short**. Please note you will not see the **Create a Short** option if you are outsides of India.

Next, use the **Speed** and **Timer** icons to set the speed of the video and the countdown timer duration before the app starts recording the video when you press the **Record** button respectively.

Now tap the **Record** button from the bottom to start recording a video and stop to stop the recording. Make sure to shoot the footage in the portrait mode (ideally in the 9:16 aspect ratio). Tap **NEXT** from the bottom-right corner to proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Add Text and Music to the Short Video**

On the next window, use the **Music** and **Text** buttons from the bottom-left corner to add a background music and caption to the video, and tap **NEXT** from the top-right corner.

**Step 3:** **Upload and Post the Short Video**

On the **Add details** window, enter a name for the video along with the **#Shorts** tag in the **Create a title** field, tap **Select audience** to select the target audience, and tap **UPLOAD** from the top-right corner to upload the short video on YouTube.

**Conclusion**

Learning the process of **how to post short videos on YouTube** is fairly simple as long as you have the video recorded in the portrait orientation, it is up to 60 seconds long, and contains the ‘#Shorts’ tag (without quotes) in the title or description. The good thing is, if you don’t have access to the YouTube app on your smartphone, the method for **how to upload short video on YouTube** explained in the first section can be followed while using your desktop computer.

## Part 1: How to Remove YouTube Videos that You've Uploaded

**You may also like:**[How to Edit Uploaded YouTube Videos >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 The first thing that we are going to show you is how to remove your own videos. This might be needed if you have uploaded content quite some time ago and it is already outdated. Or, if you have too many videos on your channel and you need to clear up those who aren't that interesting.

 The fact of the matter is that it's quite easy to remove YouTube videos. The first thing that you would need to do is going ahead and hop on the website and log into your account. Afterwards, you need to go to the “My Channel” option and click on the “Video Manager”.

 Upon doing this, a new page is going to pop up, and you are going to see a list of all the videos that you've uploaded.

![Video list](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-youtube-video-basic-description-3.jpg)

 There are little tick boxes on the left side which you can click in order to mark. Mark the videos that you want to edit and click on the “Actions” button on top. There is going to be a drop-down menu, and you can click on the delete option to remove the video permanently. Furthermore, you can also hide the video if you don't want to delete it but only to hide it away from your subscribers. In order to do so, you should simply click on the Private or Unlisted button.

![remove youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/how-to-remove-youtube-videos.jpg)

 That's pretty much it – there's nothing further to it, and the entire thing is rather comprehensive and easy to carry out, which makes it convenient to go through.

## Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels

 Now that we've covered how to remove videos from your own channel, it's time to dig a little bit deeper. There are certain instances in which you might want to remove YouTube videos from other channels as well. The reasons for this are usually rather personal. For instance – someone has uploaded a video including you or something yours without your consent, and this harms your reputation. Furthermore, it may display sensitive information that you don't want to reveal to anyone else – the reasons are rather different, but they are related to your own individual privacy which is an important legal right.

**You may also like:**[How to Blur Faces in YouTube Videos >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 The first thing you can do is contact the person who uploaded the video and kindly asks him to remove it using the procedure that we described above. This is going to be the best choice because it's going to achieve the result quickly and without any hassle. However, in certain cases, the person might not be active, or he might disagree with you and keep the video posted. If that's the case, you have one option which is likely to be the best alternative.

 You need to report the video as an inappropriate and flag it with the remark that it's invading your privacy. This is going to lead you to the page of the YouTube Safety Center. You will have to explain the issue in details in a six-step wizard which extensively asks you about how the video is invasive to your privacy rights. The process is quite comprehensive, and it's easy to go through. However, you will have to wait for the YouTube support team to assess it and make the decision for the removal.

![remove other's youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-youtube-videos-1.jpg)

 The truth is that being able to remove YouTube videos is something important that you should be able to do. It's going to ensure that your channel is perfectly updated, aligned and structured while at the same time making sure that everything is in line with your privacy. YouTube is a powerful website, and you need to be able to stay in control in order to be protected.
