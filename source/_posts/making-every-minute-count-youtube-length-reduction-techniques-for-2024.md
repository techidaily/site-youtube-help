## How to Edit YouTube Video Length Using the built-in Video Editor

The YouTube video editor is easy to use, and you can easily learn how to do all sorts of changes to your video. Let's see the things that you need to go through in order to edit the length.

**Note:** From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complimentary editing suite. Check the best [YouTube video editor alternatives](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from this complete guide.

#### Step 1 Get to the video editor

![Locate YouTube Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-6.jpg)

In order to do so, you would have to go ahead and login into your account. Then, go to the “My Channel” panel and select the video that you want to cut. Once you've done this, click on the “Video manager” option and click on the “create” tab which should be located on the right side for the page. There, you will be able to find the “Video Editor”. Of course, you can also add “/editor” to YouTube's URL, and you would be good to go.

#### Step 2 Import Your Video

Once you've done all of the above, you would have to drag your video in order to cut it's time. Keep in mind that the videos are made out of a maximum of 50 clips. The site is going to save every single video that you upload as a particular clip which could be properly combined with the rest in order to make one larger video. This is important.

![drag video to YouTube timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-video-to-youtube-timeline.jpg)

#### Step 3 Edit the Length

This is the part where you actually get to edit the length of your video. In order to do so effectively, you have to drag the bar at either end of your clip towards the other end in order to shorten the clip conveniently.

![edit video length in youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-length-in-youtube.jpg)

What is more, if you want to increase the length, you have to drag the bar to the opposite end – outwards. There is going to be an indicator which is going to appear at the bottom of the clip, and it's going to show you the overall duration of the file, and it's going to adjust itself as you slide the bars accordingly.

#### Step 4 Save the Clip

Of course, you would have to save the clip in order for the changes to reflect. Even though this might seem like a particularly obvious thing to do, you would be surprise to find out that a lot of people get everything done and then discard the changes by forgetting to save them and their effort goes to waste.

## Top 7 Android Ad Blockers: Your Choice Comparison

Developers make money by including ADS in their applications. They have two alternatives for customers who want to use their apps: either pay for such a lifetime purchase of the app or enjoy the free version that includes ADS. Best ad blocker for android helps eliminate ADS from apps installed on our Android devices.

Many people choose to use the free version since they can't afford to pay for a standard app, while some opt for Mods, but the best method to avoid ADS is to use programs that block them entirely. Although most of the best ad blockers for android applications listed below work on browsers, you may need to root your Android smartphone to utilize some of them.

Let's get started with this article's list of the best ad blocker for android applications, which will help you get rid of the annoying ads you encounter in apps regularly.

Free ad blocker for android apps

To find the best free ad blocker for android apps, you're probably searching for an app that can block ads in the browser rather than system-wide ad blocking (as explained above). If you're looking for ad-blocking software for your Android phone, there are a plethora of free, high-quality options.

### 1.AdAway

![adaway-for-android-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adaway-for-android-poster.png)

AdWay is the best free ad blocker for android apps. Even though AdAway is a free program, it can block all adverts on your smartphone. There are no security checks on the Google Play store, but as it is open-source software, anybody may verify its code for safety and problems should be rapidly fixed.

**Features:**

* Ads are blocked on all devices.
* Whitelisting and blacklisting are both options for a high degree of personalization.
* Access to the root filesystem is not necessary (optional)

### 2.AdBlock

![adlock-for-android-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adlock-for-android-poster.png)

AdBlock is a good and free ad blocker for android apps that does a good job at preventing ads. Even though it doesn't seem like much, it does the job of blocking banners, pop-ups, pop-unders, and other types of adverts.

**Features:**

* Multiple Android browsers are supported: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, & more.
* It prevents advertising and trackers from loading, allowing you to browse more quickly.

### 3.TrustGo Ad Detector

![trustgo-ad-detector-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trustgo-ad-detector-poster.png)

TrustGo Ad Detector works a little differently than the best and free ad blocker for android apps in that it analyses your device to find the source of advertising and trackers. Then you can choose whether or not to snooze or remove the programs that are constantly bombarding you with intrusive adverts and pop-ups.

**Features:**

* It detects unwanted programs and allows you to take back control of your smartphone.
* identifies potentially dangerous applications that might steal your personal information
* It's simple to use.
