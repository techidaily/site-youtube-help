Monetizing YouTube Shorts has the potential to make decent earnings. Although the amount is not as much as a long-form videos, it is a great way of making money on YouTube quickly. Most YouTube Shorts creators agree that the revenue per thousand views (RPM) for short-form content is currently around $0.05 - $0.07\. This means that for a million Shorts views, you will make $50 - $70.

### **Factors** **That Influence Earnings**

The amount of money you make on YouTube Shorts is not fixed. It will depend on several factors, including the revenue channel and your interactions with viewers

* **Ad revenue:** A higher view count on Shorts increases ad revenue from the ads that are between Shorts on the platform.
* **Viewer engagement:** Viewer engagement brings in additional revenue through features like Super Thanks.
* **Number of monetized Shorts:** Monetizing most of your short-form videos will increase the revenue generated.
* **Shopping Revenue:** How well you promote your products and the set price point of the products will determine the shopping revenue generated.

### **Examples of Creators Who Have Earned from Shorts**

The revenue-sharing program is the easiest way for creators to earn money on YouTube. Since monetizing their Shorts, these creators earned some decent bonus amounts:

* [Hassan Khadair](https://www.youtube.com/@HassanKhadair) (2.1 million subscribers) - Earned $872.14 in ads from 22 million Shorts views
* [Riley Lemon](https://www.youtube.com/@RileyDoingThings) (84,000 subscribers) - Earned $76.23 in ads from 1.9 million Shorts views
