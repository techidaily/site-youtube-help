 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Latest survey shows that Google’s video streaming site Youtube has surpassed radio, as well as CDs to be the most popular way American adolescents listen to music. Almost 91% of the music fans would listen to the samples before they purchase a song on iTunes. “Watching” music is getting more and more popular with Youtube’s arising popularity among music fans.

 However, here comes the dilemma if you are trying to share your favorite music list with your friends on Youtube since Youtube is not designed to host files that are purely audio.

#### 1 Import Files to Audio Converter

 Before upload MP3 to YouTube, you can collect the relevant image, album cover or band picture to your music. Then run this MP3 to YouTube converter and choose 16:9 or 4:3 ratio according to your needs. After that, click “Import” to add the MP3 file and the pictures to the program. Then all the imported files will be displayed as thumbnails in the Media library.

#### 2 Add Pictures to MP3 Files

 Drag and drop your MP3 file to the music layer, and the picture to the video layer. These will be located under the timeline bar. Then choose the picture and move your mouse to expand the picture exposure time frame exactly as long as your MP3 file. If less, the remaining part will be blacked out, while too long will create silence in the overextended portions of the video.
