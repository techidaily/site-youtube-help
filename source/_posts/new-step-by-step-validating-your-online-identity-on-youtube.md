## Upgrading Your Spotify Library to YouTube Music Access

Do you want to transfer your playlist to YouTube Music from Spotify? After all, there are some significant advantages to using the former over the latter. For one, YouTube Music offers a broader range of songs and videos without ads.

Though Spotify is a widely used music streaming app, its many limitations for non-Premium members have driven users to look for alternatives. For example, 30-second ads that play every 15 minutes and the inability to skip songs are among the app's most frustrating features.

So, if you're ready to **convert Spotify playlists to YouTube Music**, let's get started!
