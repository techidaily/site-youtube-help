## Top Features about YouTube App (especially for YouTube Creators, not for Viewers)

 If you wish to learn more about the YouTube app for iPhone or YouTube app for Android, check out the following features:

#### 1.Sync all of your devices

 First and foremost, it is worth pointing out that YouTube app is able to sync all of your devices. In this way, you do not need to worry about having YouTube installed on multiple devices. You can use the app on either one of these devices in the most efficient manner. In fact, you can choose which account you are going to use, should you have multiple Google accounts and hence multiple YouTube accounts.

#### 2.Rich resources

 When you upload videos from the app, you can apply music or special filters to make the most of their looks. When it comes to music, there is a rich in-built library that allows you to browse through some truly great audio tracks. If you find something you like, you can use it to add style and character to your uploaded video. There is the option to preview the changes and conclude as to whether or not they appeal to you before posting.

#### 3.Editing features

 Using the editing features available on the app, you can fully customize the way your video looks in the end. You can apply a plethora of different filters, which will offer you the chance to better control the final outcome. By constantly previewing the video, you have total control over what your video is going to look like in the end. When you sue that feature prior to uploading the video, it can save you from a lot of trouble and unnecessary work.

#### 4.Quickly check out any updates

 All the channels you have subscribed to will appear horizontally, allowing you to quickly check out any updates. In this way, you do not need to waste any time trying to search through the various channels and see what they have been up to. This will save you a great deal of time and effort, while it will alert you without any delay about new releases.

#### 5.Minimize a video during your ongoing research

 Another cool feature that will help you out a great deal is the option of minimizing a video during your ongoing research on YouTube app for Android and iPhone.

There is a special command on the menu of your app that enables you to watch the videos on your TV. So this will give you the opportunity to enjoy high-quality music on a much bigger screen.

 Last but not least, you can always use the Watch Later button to catch up on videos that you do not have the time to enjoy right away. Whether you have already started watching them and turn out to take longer than expected or you have not checked them out yet, you can add them to your watch list and ensure they are ready when you need them.

## Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion

This one is little longer but many people vote for it as a safer one! All you have to do is to login to your YouTube official account and download all the videos that you have uploaded in MP4 format by clicking on Edit option appearing at right of the video.

Next, click on channel drop-down menu and choose a category which best describes your video. Besides this, you would see a ‘Tags’ text box. You can add one or more tags (maximum 10) and select the privacy options as per your requirement. Tags act as a criterion for SEO optimization and help people in finding your video. Finally, just click on save to upload the video on dailymotion.

## Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion

You can do this by liaising with Freedom MCN Network as it allows you to grow faster on Dailymotion. All you have to do is to search for ‘dashboard.tm’ on Google and sign in using you email and password. It will direct you to Dailymotion page; you can also opt to sign in with your Facebook credentials. When you will press enter and login, the first screen only will show the prompt if you want to synch YouTube and Dailymotion channels? Since, our answer is yes, the screen will ask you to login into your YouTube account and the screen will navigate you to the login into Google account linked to your YouTube account. Just like in all apps, you have to allow Freedom to access the data from your YouTube account. The next screen will list down number of videos that have been uploaded to your YouTube Account and the ones which are already synched with Dailymotion will have a check against their name. The ones which are not synched will have a box; you can simply check it and click on ‘Synch videos’ at the top right corner.

It will ask for your email address to get notifications, put in your email ID and click on Sync. Once they are active and synched you will receive a notification on your email with a subject ‘Done reuploading’ followed by the tile of the video. This simply means that you need not upload any video separately on dailymotion, you can simply synch it with YouTube and put in your efforts of uploading only once!
