_Check out our most updated guide on this topic: [The Best Free Video Editing Software for YouTube - Top 8 Reviews](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)._

Looking for free video editing software? Thanks to high-end smartphone cameras and affordable video recording equipment, it has never been easier to make great looking YouTube videos. However, many talented creators struggle to edit their videos without having to spend a lot of money. Fortunately, there are numerous free video editing software programs that can be used for this purpose, allowing content creators to complete and publish high-quality content even if they operate on a moderate budget.

Here is a list of great software that can be used free of charge:

1. [Avidemux](#avidemux)
2. [Blender](#blender)
3. [Wondershare Filmii](#filmii)
4. [Hitfilm Express](#hitfilm)
5. [iMovie](#imovie)
6. [Lightworks](#lightworks)
7. [Machete Video Editor Lite](#machete)
8. [Open Shot](#openshot)
9. [Shotcut](#shotcut)
10. [Video Pad](#videopad)
11. [VSDC Free Video Editor](#vsdc)
12. [WeVideo](#wevideo)
13. [Windows Movie Maker](#windows)

## 1\. [Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/)

Available for: Windows, Mac OS X, Linux

Perhaps the strongest argument in favor of Avidemux is its extreme flexibility. This free video editor is available for Windows, iOS, and Linux, and it supports a wide variety of formats and codecs. It is primarily intended for basic cutting, but in the hands of a capable editor, it can perform very well on more demanding projects. Avidemux is also known for its strong scripting capacities, which allow for faster execution of routine tasks and consequently a more streamlined video production process.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

As you can see, there is no shortage of free video editing software suites. However, free software does tend to be either very limited, or very specifically targeted (i.e. Blender is specifically for animators). Wondershare's [**Filmora** **Video Editor**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great choice for YouTubers and other video creators who are starting to grow out of programs like Windows Movie maker. You can even try all the features for free, for as long as you like! Exports from the free trial do have a watermark, though.
