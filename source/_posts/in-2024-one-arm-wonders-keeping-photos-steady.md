When you’re trying to grow a channel on YouTube it can feel like equipment is a barrier, but it shouldn’t be. If you can’t afford a high-end tripod, for example, there are loads of ways to get by without one.

### DIY Your Video with Wondershare Filmora

Wondershare Filmora has the best video stabilization tool is your videos have a bad frame or were recorded in dim lights. If a video is shot in bad weather or unfriendly situation where you don’t have all the equipment required for a quality recording, Wondershare Filmora can help you in the background to edit your videos like a pro. And it has all the relevant tools like effects, transitions, background removal, overlays, and background music that could turn your normal video to a professional one.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Here are 3 of our favorite DIY tripods.

### **DIY smartphone tripod using binder clips or hair clips**

You’re a solo operation and your best camera is on your phone. That’s pretty common.

If you have a DSLR then you can set it down on any stable surface while filming yourself, but your phone can’t stand up by itself. It needs something or someone to hold it. Do you just accept that and shoot everything as a selfie?

No. No, you don’t, because there are common household items that can help you out of this problem. For this DIY tripod, you need either **2 binder clips** or **2 ‘claw clips’** (also called ‘hair jaws’).

Hold your phone in landscape mode (horizontally, so it’s long rather than tall) and attach clips to the bottom corners. If you are worried about scratching your screen, fold up some paper to place between your clip and your phone.

Here it is with binder clips:

![binder clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/binder-clips.jpg)

And here it is with hair clips:

![hair clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hair-clips.jpg)

Now you can set your smartphone upon any stable surface, like a table or a stack of books.

 _Here are some more cool ideas!_

### **DIY adjustable tripod using books and a towel**

You’ve probably heard a million times that you can stabilize your camera by sitting it down on any stable surface – on your desk, on a stack of books, up in a tree, etc. This is very true!

But if you can use any stable surface, why do people buy tripods?

Because it isn’t convenient to rearrange your furniture whenever you want to make a video, and also because tripods are adjustable. You can change their height, you can use them to pan or tilt, and it’s pretty easy to move them a bit forwards or backward while you’re setting up your shot.

To get similar functions from the ‘any stable surface’ solution you can use a **table**, a **stack of books**, and a **towel**.

1. Set up the area where you’re going to sit while you’re filming on one end of the table.
2. Put the towel down over the approximate spot you want your camera to be.
3. Stack your books on top of the towel.
4. Put your camera on top of the books.

Now if your camera isn’t up high enough, or is too high, you can adjust it just by adding or taking away books. If you want to move it closer or farther away from you, just pull the towel forwards or backward.

### **DIY gripping ‘Gorillapod’ using wire and tape**

Gorillapod’s are cool because you can use them like normal tripods, carry them around like selfie sticks, or attach them to things like fences and posts. Here’s how you can make something similar using **wire**, **electrical tape** or **duct tape**, and a **1/4 bolt**.

Your wire should be fairly stiff and you’ll need three pieces the same length, which should be at least 10 inches. Old clothes hangers work well. This needs to be something strong enough to support the weight of your camera, but soft enough that it’s not impossible for you to bend.

 ![wire and type](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wire-and-type.jpg)

_All of your supplies plus the finished product._

**Readying your legs**

**_Step 1:_** Bend 2 inches at one end of each wire into a ‘U’ shape. You will probably need pliers for this.

**_Step 2:_** Pick up one of your pieces of wire and wrap one end with electrical tape. Go around 5-10 times (to prevent it from coming undone at the end) and then, without cutting your tape, start moving up and wrapping the rest of your wire. Stop before your ‘U’ section.

Repeat this with the other two wires.

 **Attaching your legs**

_**Step 1:**_ Place the ‘U’ section of a leg against your bolt. The bolt’s threading should be pointing away from the leg. Now, use your tape to attach them. Wind it around 2 or 3 times, then repeat the process with both of the other legs individually.

_**Step 2:**_ After all the legs are attached, wrap some more tape around all 3 as tightly as you can.

 Your camera will mount onto the bolt! You’ll be able to use this as a normal table-top tripod or use the flexible legs to grab onto different things like a Gorillapod. _Read more at_ [_Instructables_.](http://www.instructables.com/id/Pocket-Tripod/)

_Note: make sure the bolt is a fit for your camera before you get too far into this process._

## Going Against Gravity: Reversing Your Vids

# Best YouTube Video Reverser Online

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

While working on the movies in a professional post-production environment, there might be instances where you want to **reverse YouTube video** to show flashback effect, or to replay a sequence so the audience can experience more thrills while watching.

With that said, not every media player or video editing application is capable enough to reverse a movie clip, not at least with merely a few mouse clicks. Therefore, the following sections suggest some such programs that can help you **play YouTube video backward**.

## Part 1: Best Free YouTube Video Reversers Online

There are a few online web programs that are capable of reversing YouTube videos with efficiency. However, some of them may have certain restrictions like file size limit, number of supported formats, fewer or absolutely no editing options, etc.

Nevertheless, the best five online solutions to **reverse YouTube video** along with the process of using them are discussed below:

### 1. Clideo

Clideo is not merely a video reverser, but can also convert media files to your preferred format. You can paste the URL of a YouTube video to upload or import the videos from your computer, Dropbox or Google Drive storage. At the time of this writing, Clideo allows only up to **500MB** videos to be uploaded to reverse or convert. As for the acceptability, the portal supports almost all the commonly used formats.

![Reverse YouTube videos Online - Clideo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-youtube-video-clideo.jpg)

To **play YouTube video backward** with Clideo:

* Visit Clideo’s online reverse tool page: <https://clideo.com/reverse-video>;
* Hover mouse over the down arrow icon next to the **Choose file** button and paste the URL of the YouTube video that you want to reverse;
* After Clideo fetches the video and opens the next page, choose your preferred speed from the right section
* Leave the **Mute video** box checked, or uncheck it if required and then click **Reverse** button to **reverse YouTube video.** The maximum reverse speed that you can apply is 2X.

### 2. Kapwing

This web solution also supports almost all types of video formats including 3GPP, AVI, MP4, etc. When talking about the limitations of a free user, you can only upload the videos that are up to 7 minutes long. At the time of this writing, Kapwing can accept the source files from your computer, and from the YouTube URL.

![Reverse YouTube videos Online - kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-youtube-video-kapwing.jpg)

To **reverse YouTube video** with Kapwing:

* Go to Kapwing’s online video reverser page: <https://www.kapwing.com/tools/reverse-video>;
* Paste the URL of the YouTube video in the **Paste a URL** field;
* Select your preferred playback speed of the reversed video from the **Reverse speed** section in the left pane;
* Choose whether or not Kapwing should mute the output video;
* Optionally, click **Trim video** from the upper-left corner of the right window to edit the footage if needed;
* Click **CREATE** from the bottom-left corner to **play YouTube video backward.** The maximum reverse speed that you can apply on Kapwing is also 2X.

### 3. EZGIF

With the ability to support almost all major video formats, and the capability to accept the media files of up to 100MB, Ezgif allows you to upload the footages from your PC, or paste their URL if they are published on YouTube. Even though the landing page has a few distracting adverts, the overall process to **play YouTube video backward** and save it to your PC is simple.

![Reverse YouTube videos Online - EZGIF](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-youtube-video-ezgif.jpg)

To **reverse YouTube video** with Ezgif:

* Go to the reverser tool page: <https://ezgif.com/reverse-video> and then paste the URL of the YouTube video in the available field;
* Click **Upload video** and optionally click the **speed** icon from the toolbar at the top;
* Use the checkboxes and input fields to mute the audio and adjust the playback speed as needed;
* Choose your preferred encoding method from the **Output format and encoding** drop-down list and then click **Reverse video** to reverse the video.

Note: It seems that you can’t customize the reverse speed on EZGif but you can choose to mute the reversed audio or not.

### 4. VideoReverser

Although this web solution has an extremely simple interface, the files that you can upload must not exceed 10MB in size. The portal supports formats like MPG, MPEG, MP4, AVI, M4V, 3GP, etc. for reversing. In addition to uploading the clips from your PC, VideoReverser also allows you to paste the URL of the footages if they are published on YouTube.

![Reverse YouTube videos Online - VideoReverser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-youtube-video-video-reverser.jpg)

To **play YouTube video backward** with VideoReverser:

* Launch your favorite Internet browser, and then visit <https://www.videoreverser.com/>;
* Paste the URL of the YouTube video in the available text field;
* Choose your preferred output format from the **Select output format** drop-down list;
* Use the **Remove audio track** checkbox to get rid of the acoustics or leave the sound enabled;
* Click **Start** to **reverse YouTube video.**

### 5. Pixiko

With almost all formats’ support, Pixiko is yet another web-based media editor that can also **reverse YouTube video** with a few mouse clicks. At the time of this writing, Pixiko only accepts the source files from your PC, which means you can’t paste the YouTube link to it directly. At first, you need to download or save the YouTube video on computer and then either drag those clips from your local hard drive to the portal.

![Reverse YouTube videos Online - Pixiko](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-youtube-video-pixiko.jpg)

To **play YouTube video backward** with Pixiko:

* On the page <https://pixiko.com/editor/video-reverse>, click anywhere inside the Blue rectangle;
* Locate, select, and upload the downloaded YouTube source video from your PC;
* Click **Reverse** from the lower-right section of the video player window;
