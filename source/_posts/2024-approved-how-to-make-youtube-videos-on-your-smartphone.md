 It is fun to be able to record a vlog entry whenever inspiration strikes you, and your smartphone is a great choice for recording on the go. Smartphones have really great cameras, and you probably always have your phone with you. You can even post directly from your phone to YouTube!

## How To Make YouTube Videos on Your Smartphone

 Making a video on your smartphone is similar to making a video with any other camera in a lot of ways. There are also a lot of ways in which it is different. You always have to watch out for camera shake, for example, but it can be even harder to control when you’re walking around shooting on your mobile device. Here are three things to keep in mind when vlogging with your smartphone.

#### Part 1\. Keep It Steady

 For a nice, smooth, shot consider resting your hand up on a railing, table, or anything else that will keep it steady while you film. Camera shake is always distracting to viewers, and smartphone videos are notoriously unstable because you are almost always holding your phone in your hand.

 There is equipment you can use to cut out camera shake. You can get a smartphone mount for your tripod, or you can even stabilize your phone using a selfie stick. Many of the very newest smartphones have built in hardware called ‘OIS’ – optical image stabilization – that helps reduce shakiness.

#### Part 2\. Be Heard

 You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you say it! Smartphones do not tend to have very good microphones built in (neither do most cameras), so try to vlog from somewhere without a lot of background noise. It will help a lot if your voice has nothing to compete with.

 Ideally, you should get an external mic to record your voice while you vlog on your phone. There are shotgun mics you can plug directly into the audio jack on your phone which will record great audio, or you can get a high quality MP3 recorder and carry it around in your pocket.

#### Part 3\. Tilt Your Phone

 When recording on the spur of the moment with your smartphone it is easy to automatically hold it the same way you would while texting or taking a selfie. If you record a video with your phone held so that it is tall – a ‘portrait’ shot – then your video will have thick black bars on either side when you post it to YouTube. If you tilt your phone so that it is wide you will record a ‘landscape’ shot, which will match the dimensions YouTube plays videos in.

 The exception to this is videos you plan to post on Instagram. On Instagram everything is cropped into a square, and it is easier to imagine what your footage will look like as a square when you hold your phone strait up. Simply focus on the top of your screen and treat a portion of the bottom of your screen as if it is not there. When you hold your phone horizontally you need to try and estimate how much of the middle of your screen will make it in to your Instagram video, which can be awkward.

 Those are the three main things to keep in mind, but if you are planning on posting directly to YouTube from your phone then you should also make sure you have a mobile app you can use to edit it first.

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)is a full-feature video editing app available for both Android and iPhone operating systems. With Filmora you can make awesome YouTube videos quickly using Filmora’s one-touch themes, or take a little bit more time personalizing your creation. One-touch themes are sets of related features, like filters and animated titles, which you can apply to your videos all at once. Filmora’s simple interface also makes it easy to apply filters, titles, overlays, transitions, and even royalty free music to your project one at a time.

 After you’ve edited your video in Filmora you can post it directly to YouTube or other social media sites right from the app.

**YouTube:** YouTube is a well-known website for watching all kind of videos. It was launched in February 2005 and today it is serving like one of the biggest social media network. This platform was actually designed by few creative PayPal workers.

**Dailymotion:** It is a French social site and one popular competitor against YouTube. This site was launched by Orange on 15th March, 2005\. You can watch wide range of videos on Dailymotion but for limited duration of time.

## Difference between YouTube and Dailymotion

 Here we few key terms that can help you to understand difference between YouTube and Dailymotion:

#### 1.Numbers

 The total number of viewers that interact with site like Dailymotion and YouTube is actually one of the important parameter for business because it decides the number of video ads and text that will be placed on site. We all know that YouTube is world’s biggest network for videos and Dailymotion follows it at second number. Statistics reveal that there are so many advantages of YouTube over Dailymotion, especially in terms of total site visitors as YouTube gets billions of visitors per month but this count is limited to 112 million visitors in case of Dailymotion.

#### 2.3D Videos

 3D videos are one of the biggest needs of viewers these days so its availability on site definitely boosts site importance in market. As YouTube is developed with Beta so it is capable enough to provide impressive 3D viewing experience to viewers but on the other side, Dailymotion lacks behind in this capability. You cannot enjoy 3D content on Dailymotion screens.

#### 3.Video Quality

 One more important criterion for comparison between YouTube and Dailymotion is the overall allowed time limit for video uploads. In case of Dailymotion, you will often find all videos with less than 60 minute duration but on YouTube, video can be of any big length as it never poses any restriction on the basis of time duration. Here is one wonderful thing to know that on YouTube videos of worth 72 hour duration are uploaded per second. And viewers in YouTube are capable enough to watch fresh videos day and night.

 Sadly, Dailymotion cannot give you this much freedom about content and naturally here YouTube again stays on advantageous side for users. May be this is the biggest reason behind billions of having visitors on YouTube platform as compared to only 112 million visitors over Dailymotion.

#### 4.Analytics

 You might be aware about the fact that YouTube is owned by Behemoth Google; that is why it possesses most robust analytics tools as like YouTube insights. With these advanced tools, businesses as well as individuals can monitor their viewers on videos. They can also make analysis about how long and how often a particular visitor stays on videos. It helps businesses to improve their video content so that more visitors can be attracted. Dailymotion cannot offer you such details, here you can access just publication date of video, nothing else. The true fact is that Dailymotion itself has a YouTube channel that users often access to upload multiple videos so that Dailymotion can avail some promotions.

## Tips for Editing YouTube and Dailymotion Videos

 If you often watch, download or upload videos on YouTube and Dailymotion platform then you may also need to edit them time to time. In order to fulfil this need you may need editing software. Professionals recommend Wondershare Filmora as one of the best and easiest editing tool with wide range of features. It can process more than 150 video file formats so you can easily edit whatever you want to customize.

In case of Dailymotion, you will often find all videos with less than 60 minute duration but on YouTube, video can be of any big length as it never poses any restriction on the basis of time duration. Here is one wonderful thing to know that on YouTube videos of worth 72 hour duration are uploaded per second. And viewers in YouTube are capable enough to watch fresh videos day and night.

 Sadly, Dailymotion cannot give you this much freedom about content and naturally here YouTube again stays on advantageous side for users. May be this is the biggest reason behind billions of having visitors on YouTube platform as compared to only 112 million visitors over Dailymotion.

#### 4.Analytics

 You might be aware about the fact that YouTube is owned by Behemoth Google; that is why it possesses most robust analytics tools as like YouTube insights. With these advanced tools, businesses as well as individuals can monitor their viewers on videos. They can also make analysis about how long and how often a particular visitor stays on videos. It helps businesses to improve their video content so that more visitors can be attracted. Dailymotion cannot offer you such details, here you can access just publication date of video, nothing else. The true fact is that Dailymotion itself has a YouTube channel that users often access to upload multiple videos so that Dailymotion can avail some promotions.
