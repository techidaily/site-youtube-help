This is the text on your About page. It explains to your visitors what your channel is all about. What can they expect from you? You should put this information in your channel description. It's how you can get discovered by people looking for content exactly like what you offer. Basically, your channel description is like an ad. It tells other users why they should subscribe to your channel.

## Tips for Creating an Amazing YouTube Description

YouTube is not only telling people that they should watch your content. It also tells YouTube to recommend the video to users searching for something to watch. YouTube crawls the description to rank your videos in search results. That said, you must do it right. Here are some tips you should keep in mind.

1. Include the most important keywords in your video description.
2. Inform viewers what to expect from the video. What is it about? Is it a travel blog, food review, or what?
3. Add relevant hashtags to your video description.
4. Add links (relevant resources, your socials, timestamps, links to your other videos, etc.)
5. Ensure the hook is attention-grabbing. Otherwise, people would ignore it and your video altogether.
6. Add a call-to-action to remind your viewers to like and subscribe.
7. Note that only the first 200 characters will appear on the screen. Users need to click the "Show More" button to view the rest. So put what's most important in the first 200 characters.

### Benefits of Using a YouTube Description Templates

If you have a business or something on the internet that needs promotion, you think of SEO (Search Engine Optimization.) It makes the material appear more often and higher on searches.

When thinking about SEO, people think of Google. And rightly so. It is the largest search engine in the world. But SEO is also important on YouTube - the world's second-largest search engine. The thing is that SEO for videos on YouTube is different from SEO for Google or other engines.

## 5 Best YouTube Video Description Template

Now, you are well aware of the importance of YouTube descriptions. That may have made you feel more pressured to write fantastic ones. Here are 5 YouTube description templates you can use so it would not be much of a problem.

### 1\. YouTube Video Description About New Products

_The \[latest version of your product\] is HERE! Download and Try \[latest version of your product\] now: \[Download link\]_

Do you have a business that sells products? You can use this template for your new product launches.

### 2\. YouTube Video Description for Educational Videos

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. YouTube Video Description for Funneling Viewers Into Your Website

_This video will show you a preview of \[topic.\] If you're interested to learn more about this and what we do, please visit us at \[website link.\] You can also reach out to us at \[contact information.\]_

Please note that this is not the whole description. Rather, it is only the first 200 characters of it. As you can see, it's a CTA. It's wise to put it there because that part is what people would see the most. They'd have to click the "See More" button to read the rest of the description. And not everyone will click that.

**Tip:** Use URL shorteners if your website URL is too long. Remember that you only have 200 characters to use. So every character you can remove counts.

### 4\. YouTube Video Descriptions for How-To Videos With Products
