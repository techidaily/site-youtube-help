## Circulating Content: The Art of Playlist Sharing

YouTube has become the most popular video-sharing platform on the internet, with users from all over the world uploading and watching videos daily. You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.

But what if you've created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we've put together an extensive guide on **how to** **share a YouTube playlist** on your computer and mobile devices.

So, let's get started with our guide without any further delay!

## Why Doesn't The Share Function In The Playlist Work?

Firstly, let's figure out why the "Share" function doesn't work. The "Share" function in the playlist does not work because it is set to "private," and YouTube doesn't allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to "public" in the following way:

Step1 Head to the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.

Step2

* **Click** the three-line **"Menu"** icon at the top-left of your screen.
* Go to **"Library."**
* Scroll down to the **"Playlist"** section.

![changing playlist visibility](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png)

Step3 Select your playlist labeled as **"Private."** On the next page, click the **"Private"** option in the playlist details section and select **"Public"** to change the visibility of your playlist.

Once the privacy setting has been changed, the **"share"** function will work as intended.

That's it! The recipient will now be able to watch the entire YouTube playlist you've shared.

##### How To Share A YouTube Playlist With A Link To Collaborate

Through the "Collaborate on playlists" feature, YouTube allows you to add friends to your playlist, who can then add videos to it.

Here's how you can share a YouTube playlist with a link to collaborate with your friends:

Step1 In the first step, go to the **YouTube** website using your preferred browser, and sign in to your channel's [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/mail/) account using your email address and password.

Step2 Click your **"Profile"** icon, choose the **"Your Channel"** option from the drop-down menu and go to the **"Playlist."**

Step3 In the next step, click the **"View Full Playlist"** option under your preferred playlist. This will take you to your playlist page.

Step4 In the details section of your YouTube playlist on the playlist page, click the **three dots (ellipsis)** icon and select the **"Collaborate"** option.

Step5 A pop-up window will appear on your screen. Toggle on the **"Collaborators can add videos to this playlist"** option to enable it, and the **"Allow new collaborators"** option will appear.

Toggle on the **"Allow new collaborators"** option, click **"Copy"** to save the URL to your clipboard, and click **"Done"** to apply the changes.
