[Tool you need: YouTube Video Editor](https://www.youtube.com/editor)

However, it lacks many basic features of modern day consumer video editing software and often crashes while dealing with large video files.

##### Get access to the editor

Sign in to your YouTube (or Google) account. Click "Upload">> "Edit" to the Video Editor tab.

[Tool you need: YouTube Video Editor](https://www.youtube.com/editor)

YouTube Video Editor is a browser-based video editor released by YouTube itself. It enables users to make minor edits to videos they've uploaded onto YouTube, as well as merge several clips together into one. It requires no additional software, or browser plug-ins (besides Adobe's Flash), which makes it convenient to use. However, it lacks many basic features of modern day consumer video editing software and often crashes while dealing with large video files.
