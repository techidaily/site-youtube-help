How can you build a personal brand on YouTube that stands out?

YouTube is oversaturated. If you do comedy, fashion, gaming, vlogging, or any other major genre then you are competing with thousands of other channels. In order to grow you need to stand out, and that’s why it’s important to build a strong, clear, brand.

## Your Brand is Your Unique Message

Competing on YouTube is all about offering value. Viewers should be able to find something on your channel that they can’t find anywhere else. This doesn’t mean you need to bend over backwards trying to[invent brand new video ideas that nobody has ever tried before](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-be-original-on-youtube-289.html) – it just means you need to focus on building your unique brand. That is what will make viewers subscribe to you instead of just watching one of your videos and then clicking away.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## The Elevator Pitch

If you had 20 seconds – a short elevator ride – to describe your channel in a way that would make someone want to subscribe, what would you say?

Think about if you were trying to describe your new favorite show to a friend. You wouldn’t stop at saying ‘it’s a comedy’ or ‘it’s about lawyers’ – that doesn’t really tell them anything. You would describe the style of comedy, the personalities of characters you love, and the kinds of plots the show offers.

You need to be able to do that when you talk about your channel.

> What is your style of comedy?
>
> What is your attitude towards fashion?
>
> What will a viewer get out of watching you make pasta that they won’t get from watching someone else make pasta?

Work on developing an elevator pitch for your channel. It will help you define your brand for yourself, and it’ll be useful if you make a channel trailer.

## How to Start Building Your Brand

Building a brand should be intentional. You need to be yourself, but it’s not enough to just ‘be’. You need to create yourself.

  In order to figure out what unique value you’re bringing to YouTube you’ll need to [pay attention to your channel stats](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/understanding-youtube-analytics-%E2%80%93-take-charge-of-your-channel%21-286.html) and comments your viewers make. It can also be a good idea to ask for feedback from friends who you know will be honest with you.

You will notice patterns. There will be things you do in your video that people consistently like more and less. The way you build your brand is by cutting out the stuff that isn’t working and focusing more intentionally on the stuff that is. If people like it when you do meme humor, for example, do more meme humor and make incorporating that in your videos part of your brand.

Banners and thumbnails are also a part of your brand. [More on that here](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-youtube-banners-and-thumbnails-316.html).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Being Consistent

The key to branding is consistency. People need to be able to set expectations.

For every video you do, ask yourself these questions:

> _Who are you?_
>
> _What is your message?_
>
> _What value are you providing?_
>
> _Who is it for?_

The answers to these questions make up your brand. They may change gradually over time – i.e. if you start making videos as a 16 year old, for other 16 year olds, then the ‘Who is it for?’ will change as you and your subscriber base get older – but in general the answers should always be the same. If your ‘message’ is positive and empowering, then it should always be positive and empowering.

When you intentionally create your personal brand on YouTube, you take charge of the message you're sending.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

When you first started your vlog you likely looked for tips from well-established vloggers. Something that may have been surprising was the amount of equipment it takes to run a successful vlog. Besides your camera you need equipment for stabilizing it, for lighting your shots, and for recording better audio than your camera is capable of. If you still don't know which camera to use, this article will tell you the [best cameras for YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Do not be overwhelmed! There are loads of affordable options for YouTube equipment. There are even some tricks you can use to get by without some pieces of equipment until you are ready to make the investment.

Here are examples of some of the best YouTube equipment. Watch for the 'Free Option!' at the bottom of every section!

#### 1\. Stabilizers for YouTube

**Selfie Stick:** A lot of vloggers like to record from their phones, and selfie sticks make great stabilizers. You can put one end on the ground and use your selfie stick similarly to a monopod. Selfie sticks are also very affordable. The Cazbe Selfie Stick is only about $40\. If you want to be a bit more sophisticated about your smartphone video then you might consider the KumbaCam 3 Axis Smart Phone Stabilizer, which is described as a 'selfie stick on steroids'. It is a pricier option at $350.

**Tripod:** A tripod is what most people think of when they think of stabilizing their cameras. Tripods come in different weights and sizes, and there are even tripods specifically for smartphones. There is a wide range of pricing for tripods. Mid-range is about $50.

**Free Option! Any Available Surface:** Kitchen tables. Desks. Park benches. Trees. Your friend's shoulder, if you ask nicely. Anything you can rest your camera on top of can be used to record a steady video.

#### 2\. Lighting for YouTube Videos

**Softbox Lights:** These are the kinds of lights that were probably used to take your school photos. They create soft, diffused, light and can be fairly affordable. The LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Lighting Kit is $167, and that is about the average.

![youtube equipment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment03.jpg)

**LED Panel Light:** LED panels produce high quality light. Prices vary. The Aputure Amaran AL-528S LED Video Light costs $358 (with stand). There are also LED panel lights which can be mounted onto your camera, like the Julius Studio NEW 160 LED 160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel Light which costs $111.

![youtube equipment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment04.jpg)

**Free Option! The Sun:** Natural light is always powerful enough to make your videos look great. Consider recording outside, or near a window in your house.

#### 3\. Audio Equipment for YouTube

**Snoball:** A Blue Snoball USB mic is an extremely affordable option at $60, although it does not have good range. You have to stay close to your computer if you use a Snoball.

 **LAV System:** A lavalier, or lapel, mic system is a lot of vloggers' favorite way to record dialogue because the mics are small and clip right on to your clothing. This is a more expensive option. The Sony LAV Wireless Mic System is $600.

![youtube equipment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment08.JPG)

 **Free Option! Audacity:**  Audacity is free audio recording/editing software that is popular with vloggers.

#### 4\. Editing Your YouTube Videos

**[Filmora Video Editor:](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** Filmora is a great program for beginners, but it is also powerful enough to satisfy more experienced vloggers. Filmora has both advanced tools like green screen or picture-in-picture, and a lot of fun features like filters, animated titles, and overlays.
