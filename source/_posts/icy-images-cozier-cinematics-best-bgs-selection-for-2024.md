## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos

Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.

### Content Relevance

As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your **background tune for YouTube videos.** For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Audience Appeal

If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.

### Lighting and Visibility

Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the **best background for YouTube videos**, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.

### Personal Branding

If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.

### Editing

If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a **green screen background for YouTube videos**.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It happens several times when we are watching some videos on YouTube and the background music of the videos appeal us the most. We go online and start searching for that unknown but heart touching song. Unfortunately, the song is not available online. But it doesn’t mean that you cannot add that song to your playlist. The great news is that there are so many advanced audio recording software tools that allow users to record audios directly from YouTube videos.

Sometimes, we are interested to play our favorite music during a long hour journey, but the missing internet connectivity does not allow us to stream it online. In such a situation also, you can get your free music easily on your iPad, iPhone, or any handheld device and it can be later burnt into CD as well. Now you might be interested to know how all this can happen without the “Record Audio” button on YouTube. Don’t worry! Below we have highlighted three simple methods to do this task:

* [Method 1: Capture Audio from YouTube with Online YouTube2MP3 Converter](#capture%5Faudio%5Ffrom%5Fyoutube%5Fwith%5Fconverter)
* [Method 2: Recording YouTube Audio with Audacity](#record%5Fyoutube%5Faudio%5Fwith%5Faudacity)
* [Method 3: Recording Sound with Streaming Audio Recorder](#record%5Fyoutube%5Faudio%5Fwith%5FStreaming%5Faudio%5Frecorder)
* [Method 4: Record Audio with Filmora](#record%5Fyoutube%5Faudio%5Fwith%5FFilmoraScrn)

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

It happens several times when we are watching some videos on YouTube and the background music of the videos appeal us the most. We go online and start searching for that unknown but heart touching song. Unfortunately, the song is not available online. But it doesn’t mean that you cannot add that song to your playlist. The great news is that there are so many advanced audio recording software tools that allow users to record audios directly from YouTube videos.

Sometimes, we are interested to play our favorite music during a long hour journey, but the missing internet connectivity does not allow us to stream it online. In such a situation also, you can get your free music easily on your iPad, iPhone, or any handheld device and it can be later burnt into CD as well. Now you might be interested to know how all this can happen without the “Record Audio” button on YouTube. Don’t worry! Below we have highlighted three simple methods to do this task:

* [Method 1: Capture Audio from YouTube with Online YouTube2MP3 Converter](#capture%5Faudio%5Ffrom%5Fyoutube%5Fwith%5Fconverter)
* [Method 2: Recording YouTube Audio with Audacity](#record%5Fyoutube%5Faudio%5Fwith%5Faudacity)
* [Method 3: Recording Sound with Streaming Audio Recorder](#record%5Fyoutube%5Faudio%5Fwith%5FStreaming%5Faudio%5Frecorder)
* [Method 4: Record Audio with Filmora](#record%5Fyoutube%5Faudio%5Fwith%5FFilmoraScrn)

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.
