## How to increase your YouTube subscribers faster

1. **Long videos should be published.**  
Research shows that the possibility of longer videos ranking high in search engines is greater than shorter ones. Aim for your video to rank high in YouTube's search engine. The best way is to have longer videos that show detailed information to viewers.
2. **Optimize watch time.**  
YouTube also factors in the watch time, both for SEO results and promotional purposes. Videos with a high watch time are likely to be promoted on the YouTube homepage. You can use lots of patterns interrupts to keep people watching or include graphics to help them focus more.
3. **Embed your videos into blog posts.**  
Blogs are a great way to tell your viewers what your product brings to the table. If you can get someone to read your post, then it shows they like your stuff. So, embed your video and let them learn via detailed steps, and they'll probably subscribe to your channel.
4. **Add a brand watermark.**  
A branding watermark helps viewers subscribe to your channel right inside the video. You can use a link that looks like a "YT subscribe" button. Also, make it large enough to be visible at a glance.
5. **Promote videos on the end screen**.  
Remember that the more someone watches your videos, the higher the chances of them subscribing to your channel. So, do the trick and promote your next video on the end screen of the current video. This will make a viewer watch more and more of your videos, and probably subscribe to your channel.
6. **Respond to every comment.**  
Show that you care. And note that every comment or review matters a lot to your brand. So, strive to respond to every comment that a viewer leaves on your page.
7. **Give thought to the channel description.**  
Here is where some YouTube channels miss it all. The description should be engaging and inviting. That’s the only way to lure viewers to hit that subscribe button. Let the description tell viewers what the channel is about and give other important information.
8. **Video quality**  
Your video is your voice when it comes to promoting your channel. Ensure you give people quality videos with a piece of detailed advice that works for them. Also, remember to upload quality videos regularly to boost the growth of your channel. A good video should have high resolution, among other good qualities.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

When you first started your vlog you likely looked for tips from well-established vloggers. Something that may have been surprising was the amount of equipment it takes to run a successful vlog. Besides your camera you need equipment for stabilizing it, for lighting your shots, and for recording better audio than your camera is capable of. If you still don't know which camera to use, this article will tell you the [best cameras for YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Do not be overwhelmed! There are loads of affordable options for YouTube equipment. There are even some tricks you can use to get by without some pieces of equipment until you are ready to make the investment.

Here are examples of some of the best YouTube equipment. Watch for the 'Free Option!' at the bottom of every section!

#### 1\. Stabilizers for YouTube

**Selfie Stick:** A lot of vloggers like to record from their phones, and selfie sticks make great stabilizers. You can put one end on the ground and use your selfie stick similarly to a monopod. Selfie sticks are also very affordable. The Cazbe Selfie Stick is only about $40\. If you want to be a bit more sophisticated about your smartphone video then you might consider the KumbaCam 3 Axis Smart Phone Stabilizer, which is described as a 'selfie stick on steroids'. It is a pricier option at $350.

![youtube equipment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment01.jpg)

**Tripod:** A tripod is what most people think of when they think of stabilizing their cameras. Tripods come in different weights and sizes, and there are even tripods specifically for smartphones. There is a wide range of pricing for tripods. Mid-range is about $50.

![youtube equipment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment02.JPG)

**Free Option! Any Available Surface:** Kitchen tables. Desks. Park benches. Trees. Your friend's shoulder, if you ask nicely. Anything you can rest your camera on top of can be used to record a steady video.

#### 2\. Lighting for YouTube Videos

**Softbox Lights:** These are the kinds of lights that were probably used to take your school photos. They create soft, diffused, light and can be fairly affordable. The LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Lighting Kit is $167, and that is about the average.

![youtube equipment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment03.jpg)

**LED Panel Light:** LED panels produce high quality light. Prices vary. The Aputure Amaran AL-528S LED Video Light costs $358 (with stand). There are also LED panel lights which can be mounted onto your camera, like the Julius Studio NEW 160 LED 160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel Light which costs $111.

![youtube equipment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment04.jpg)

![youtube equipment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment07.jpg)

![youtube equipment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment08.JPG)
