## Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?

Shorts and TikTok are not the same in various ways. TikTok first emerged in the market way before Shorts. TikTok was initially known as musically; and later revamped fully as TikTok in 2016\. It immediately gained a massive audience worldwide. This is what brought about competition from other apps, trying to replicate TikTok. Apps like Instagram and Facebook added some functionality to their platform to no match. Finally, YouTube pulled it off in 2020, rolling its version of Short videos but in beta version. These two apps have adequate similarities and differences.

They are both for short-form videos and allow creators to add music from audio libraries. You can also earn some good bucks with these two apps. However, they differ in some aspects. As Shorts can only be 15-seconds long, TikTok can go as long as three minutes. You can also view TikTok directly from its app while for Shorts, you need a separate app, YouTube.

## YouTube Shorts & TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?

Let’s focus on the TikTok and Shorts video by perusing the similarities and differences deeply.

### \- Similiarity

Check out in which aspects TikTok and Shorts are similar to each other.

##### 1) Monetization

Both platforms provide creators with tools to earn money from their content. TikTok’s first move was to pay selected influencers about $500 for joining the app and creating content. Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.

You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense. This is an in-built video monetization that creators use for showing ads on their videos. Earnings will accumulate every month-end for withdrawal.

##### 2) Analytics

Both YouTube and Shorts offer analytics like adding comments, likes, shares, and many more. Likewise, you can view your videos on either desktop or mobile platforms. With both platforms, you get an endless number of videos to watch and discover by scrolling. Also, both apps focus on short videos to entertain viewers.

##### 3) Subscribe directly to creators

You can directly get in touch with both YouTube shorts and TikTok creators. This gives an open leeway to discover new creators to follow and subscribe to. All you need to do is go to the creators’ videos in both feeds and hit the “Follow” or “Subscribe” button. Henceforth, you’ll start seeing what they post and keep in touch with their signs of progress.

##### 4) Privacy

Both apps have taken consideration into privacy issues. They allow creators to set their videos to either private or public. By this, your audience will only view what is set as “Public”. You can deter this by setting your content to “Private” or choosing who can view your content. This is a good aspect to let only those who wish to view certain clips as per your wish.

##### 5) Edit video

There’s much that your video can portray. In both apps, you choose what to give to your audience. Both platforms enable you edit your video before posting. You can alter the speed by increasing or decreasing it for slow motion. Also, you can set timers to help with the filming process among other functionalities.

### \- Difference

##### 1) Instant messaging app

Generally, YouTube is not a traditional social media platform. Even though YouTube Shorts allows users to create videos, it is not a platform that users can engage in communication via instant messaging app. On the other hand, TikTok lets you directly message other users as you share experiences. This makes TikTok a one-stop social media exchange point where you easily interact with your peers and get instant feedback. You can also create group chats and keep the fun going.

##### 2) In dependability

TikTok Shorts videos also differ from the concept of stand along and built-in features. TikTok is a standalone app that doesn’t depend on another app for its normal operations. Users can independently create content directly from the app. On the contrary, Shorts is a built-in app on YouTube and users have to access it via the YouTube platform. This may be a plus for YouTube but it could eventually turn away those who want to work independently from the app.

##### 3) Interface

With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.

### \- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need

Settling on YouTube Shorts and TikTok largely depends on your preferences. But being that TikTok has been in the limelight for a longer time, it has mastered users’ and creators’ preferences, bringing more to the table than YouTube Shorts.

Both TikTok and Shorts have an immense user base. But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.

TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.

## Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?

Shorts and TikTok are not the same in various ways. TikTok first emerged in the market way before Shorts. TikTok was initially known as musically; and later revamped fully as TikTok in 2016\. It immediately gained a massive audience worldwide. This is what brought about competition from other apps, trying to replicate TikTok. Apps like Instagram and Facebook added some functionality to their platform to no match. Finally, YouTube pulled it off in 2020, rolling its version of Short videos but in beta version. These two apps have adequate similarities and differences.

They are both for short-form videos and allow creators to add music from audio libraries. You can also earn some good bucks with these two apps. However, they differ in some aspects. As Shorts can only be 15-seconds long, TikTok can go as long as three minutes. You can also view TikTok directly from its app while for Shorts, you need a separate app, YouTube.

## YouTube Shorts & TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?

Let’s focus on the TikTok and Shorts video by perusing the similarities and differences deeply.

### \- Similiarity

Check out in which aspects TikTok and Shorts are similar to each other.

##### 1) Monetization

Both platforms provide creators with tools to earn money from their content. TikTok’s first move was to pay selected influencers about $500 for joining the app and creating content. Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.

You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense. This is an in-built video monetization that creators use for showing ads on their videos. Earnings will accumulate every month-end for withdrawal.

##### 2) Analytics

Both YouTube and Shorts offer analytics like adding comments, likes, shares, and many more. Likewise, you can view your videos on either desktop or mobile platforms. With both platforms, you get an endless number of videos to watch and discover by scrolling. Also, both apps focus on short videos to entertain viewers.

##### 3) Subscribe directly to creators

You can directly get in touch with both YouTube shorts and TikTok creators. This gives an open leeway to discover new creators to follow and subscribe to. All you need to do is go to the creators’ videos in both feeds and hit the “Follow” or “Subscribe” button. Henceforth, you’ll start seeing what they post and keep in touch with their signs of progress.

##### 4) Privacy

Both apps have taken consideration into privacy issues. They allow creators to set their videos to either private or public. By this, your audience will only view what is set as “Public”. You can deter this by setting your content to “Private” or choosing who can view your content. This is a good aspect to let only those who wish to view certain clips as per your wish.

##### 5) Edit video

There’s much that your video can portray. In both apps, you choose what to give to your audience. Both platforms enable you edit your video before posting. You can alter the speed by increasing or decreasing it for slow motion. Also, you can set timers to help with the filming process among other functionalities.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### \- Difference

##### 1) Instant messaging app

Generally, YouTube is not a traditional social media platform. Even though YouTube Shorts allows users to create videos, it is not a platform that users can engage in communication via instant messaging app. On the other hand, TikTok lets you directly message other users as you share experiences. This makes TikTok a one-stop social media exchange point where you easily interact with your peers and get instant feedback. You can also create group chats and keep the fun going.

##### 2) In dependability

TikTok Shorts videos also differ from the concept of stand along and built-in features. TikTok is a standalone app that doesn’t depend on another app for its normal operations. Users can independently create content directly from the app. On the contrary, Shorts is a built-in app on YouTube and users have to access it via the YouTube platform. This may be a plus for YouTube but it could eventually turn away those who want to work independently from the app.

##### 3) Interface

With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.

### \- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need

Settling on YouTube Shorts and TikTok largely depends on your preferences. But being that TikTok has been in the limelight for a longer time, it has mastered users’ and creators’ preferences, bringing more to the table than YouTube Shorts.

Both TikTok and Shorts have an immense user base. But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.

TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.

With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others.

## Proven Techniques for Captivating Viewers with Live Video Graphics

Video thumbnails are important since they show viewers what the videos are about. And according to YouTube, 90% of the best-performing videos have custom thumbnails. Therefore, adding thumbnails to all your videos is wise. But how to do that with live streams? Is it any different from adding thumbnails to normal videos? You'll find answers in this article. Here's a comprehensive guide about **YouTube Live thumbnails.**

![guide to youtube live thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-live-thumbnail.gif)

## Overview of YouTube Live

Livestreaming is very popular now. The pandemic has accelerated its growth. But what made it so special? Watching live streams is different from watching regular videos. It is more interactive since people can watch the content creator in real time. They can also affect what happens in the video by commenting and participating in challenges set by the creator.

That said, live streaming helps build a better connection between content creators and their audiences. So you may want to incorporate live streaming into your strategies. You can do that on YouTube through YouTube Live. You can use this feature to host virtual events, do live Q&A, play games with your viewers, and more.

## Importance of Thumbnail for Live Stream

Thumbnails are important for videos. Alongside the title, they inform the viewers what the video is about. It's not different with live streams. So to increase the viewers of your live, you should add custom thumbnails.

What happens if you don't add a custom thumbnail to your live stream? YouTube will select a random frame from the video and display it. The thing is that live streams are usually longer than recorded videos. So YouTube has more options to use as the thumbnail.

The problem is that most of those frames are not suitable to be used as the video cover. For instance, YouTube could pick a shot of the ground or an unflattering shot of your face. So, it's a must to add a custom thumbnail for your live stream.
