With videos embedded in Google Slide, viewers will find it easy to understand and digest. Videos automatically eliminate boredom and make any topic interesting.

## How to add a YouTube video to Google Slide

Use these two methods to add a YouTube video to Google Slides. Via the Search and Direct link.

#### Method 1\. Embed YouTube video to Google Slide by search and selection

Step 1\. First, go to the slide where you want to embed your video.

## How to choose the right video for your Slides?

Not all videos will make an impact on your Google Slide. You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.

**Be Professional** – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.

**Relevant** – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.

**Precise** – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.

**Know every footage you are working with** – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.

**Add new content** – even though one content may suit several presentations, don't rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.

Step 3\. Import video
Check the upper left corner of your screen to see the "Import" tab. Click on it and choose the "Import Media Files" option. Next, navigate to the location of your computer's local list to select the clip or video you want to edit. Then, hit the "Import" button to add the video to the timeline for editing.

Step 4\. Edit video  
Drag and drop the raw footage to Filmora's timeline to begin editing. Here, you can trim, add other video clips, merge, and add effects as you wish. Likewise, you can add opening titles, subtitles, and end credits to your video. More so, this tool offers different templates to use. Just drag and drop the templates you wish to use to a specific location on the timeline.

Step 5\. Preview your file  
Last but not least, you can preview your files. Click on the "Play" tab to start previewing your video clips. The main essence of this part is to allow you to make the necessary changes to your clips if there is a need.

Step 6\. Export and Share  
With Filmora, you can export your file to various social media platforms. But first, go to the "Output window" and select the video file format to use. This software supports several output formats to apply to any platform and device. Just click on the "Format" tab and choose the file format to use. Then also change the resolution and other parameters like frame rate and channel of your video in the "Settings" section. Finally, share your video to your YouTube channel and get ready to add the video to the Google Slide presentation.
