## Part 1: Free Channel Art Template Downloads

In this section you’ll find 3 sites where you can download free YouTube banners.

#### 1. [YouTube Channel Art Templates from Filmora](https://www.filmora.io/youtube-channel-art)

![ YouTube Channel Art Banner Templates Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-templates-download.png)

You can find 50 free YouTube banner templates right here on filmora.io. There are 10 different categories including popular channel types like makeup and gaming.

You have two options for every template: PSD and PNG. If you have Photoshop you’ll be able to edit the PSD file and, if you don’t, you can use the PNG as your banner background when you build your channel art in a free online program like Canva.

#### 2. Behance

Behance is a gallery of creative visual works. There is a very large collection of art you could repurpose for your channel art, but some creators on the site have also created graphics specifically to be used as YouTube banners.

Here are some channel art galleries on Behance: [Ej / Vritra](https://www.behance.net/gallery/10819163/Youtube-Background-Art), [Austin Evans](https://www.behance.net/gallery/11697655/Youtube-Channel-Art)

You can download PSD files from Behance and edit them in Photoshop. There isn’t a PNG or JPG option for people who don’t have Photoshop, though.

In order to download the templates you’ll need to hover your cursor over the Photoshop icon, and then click ‘Download Now’ when it appears. You’ll need to make an account before you can download.

#### 3. [YourTube](http://yourtubetheme.com/youtube-channel-art-templates/)

With over 500 templates available, YourTube has the largest selection on this list. They have every style you can think of, from minimalist to video game themed.

The site is run by two web designers who make the money they need to maintain the site from the few premium/paid options available (although the vast majority of templates are free).

Most of the templates are JPG backgrounds which you will need to add your own text to.

## Part 2: 9 Banner Makers with Free Templates

In this section you’ll find 9 YouTube channel art makers.

#### 1. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

Wondershare PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.

#### 2. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker)

To edit the templates available through Adobe Spark, just click on the resources in the template and then click on the images/fonts/etc you want to substitute in. Resources like filters are also very accessible.

Everything you do in Spark starts with clicking on an element in the template. You won’t see all of the menus at once, just the ones related to the element you’ve selected (i.e. the background image or the text).

The only downside of Spark is that free downloads include a watermark. The silver lining is that that watermark is small and located in the bottom-right corner, meaning that it won’t show up for viewers watching your channel on either computers or mobile devices.

_**Note:** for some reason when you click ‘Create your YouTube channel art’ it will load a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Click Resize in the side menu to switch to channel art or your exported image won’t be big enough._

#### 3. [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/)

This is a graphics creator that doubles as a banner maker. You’ll need to enter BeFunky’s ‘Designer’ tool in order to find the channel art templates under ‘Social Media Headers’ and ‘YouTube’. There’s actually only 1 free channel art template, but it is a very standard channel art layout which you can customize with your own images.

#### 4. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

Canva is one of the most popular free channel art makers. It is an easy to use, drag and drop, program that will automatically resize images to work in the spaces you drag them to. It has great free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but many are free.

The templates on Canva do tend to include paid resources, but it’s easy enough to swap them out with free resources or your own images.

#### 5. [Crello](https://blog.crello.com/a-collection-of-free-youtube-channel-art-templates/)

Crello offers 10 examples free channel art templates through their blog, and you can even edit the templates right on the site.

Crello is an easy to use visual editor created for social media and marketing, meaning that it was made to be easy for non-designers to jump into. Beyond the free templates and text options, however, most of their stock photos and backgrounds cost $1\. To use Crello for free you either need to use the default images, or upload your own.

#### 6. [Design Wizard](https://www.designwizard.com/)

This is another program with a small number of free templates that you can make almost anything out of through customization. One of the most useful features of design wizard is that it will show you the ‘safe zone’ – the area of your banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design with that in mind.

Remember to delete the safe zone marker before you export.

#### 7. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html)

Another graphics program with free templates for YouTube channel art. Fotor is easy to use – perhaps the easiest program on this list to use. In the ‘background’ tab you don’t even have to drag and drop, you just click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with. You can even load in your own images.

There are paid options in Fotor which will add a watermark to your design unless you upgrade to their paid service, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.

#### 8. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art)

If you want to get something made fast, Snappa can do that. Just find YouTube Channel Art under Headers and choose one of the free templates (there are a lot). Then it’s just a matter of swapping out the elements in the template with ones that suit your channel and clicking download.

Snappa shows you the safe areas for different devices while you edit.

#### 9. [Visme](http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/)

Visme provides 50 free channel art templates you can edit through their online graphics service. The banner maker is a big more complicated than some of the other makers on this list (it has a lot of options that are more for marketers than YouTubers, which weighs it down a bit), but the free templates are great and you can upload your own images to use with them.

How did you make your banner? Did you use a channel art template?

Beyond the free templates and text options, however, most of their stock photos and backgrounds cost $1\. To use Crello for free you either need to use the default images, or upload your own.

#### 6. [Design Wizard](https://www.designwizard.com/)

This is another program with a small number of free templates that you can make almost anything out of through customization. One of the most useful features of design wizard is that it will show you the ‘safe zone’ – the area of your banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design with that in mind.

Remember to delete the safe zone marker before you export.

#### 7. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html)

Another graphics program with free templates for YouTube channel art. Fotor is easy to use – perhaps the easiest program on this list to use. In the ‘background’ tab you don’t even have to drag and drop, you just click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with. You can even load in your own images.

There are paid options in Fotor which will add a watermark to your design unless you upgrade to their paid service, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.

#### 8. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art)

If you want to get something made fast, Snappa can do that. Just find YouTube Channel Art under Headers and choose one of the free templates (there are a lot). Then it’s just a matter of swapping out the elements in the template with ones that suit your channel and clicking download.

Snappa shows you the safe areas for different devices while you edit.

#### 9. [Visme](http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/)

Visme provides 50 free channel art templates you can edit through their online graphics service. The banner maker is a big more complicated than some of the other makers on this list (it has a lot of options that are more for marketers than YouTubers, which weighs it down a bit), but the free templates are great and you can upload your own images to use with them.

How did you make your banner? Did you use a channel art template?

## YouTube Ad Optimization 101: A Step-by-Step Guide

While there are a lot of ways you could advertise your business online, YouTube video ads are quickly becoming the most popular advertising solution. This is because more and more people choose to watch videos than any other form of video.

![youtube ad creator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-ad-creator.jpg)

But to make sure that you are putting your best foot forward when it comes to video ads, you need to invest in a YouTube ad creator that is easy to use and effective. Here, we will be looking at the best YouTube video creators that you can use.

## Why Use YouTube Video Ads

Before we look at some of the tools you can use to create YouTube video ads, it is important to mention some of the reasons why you may want to choose YouTube ads over other solutions. YouTube ads when compared to PPC are relatively cheaper and you also choose how much you are willing to pay when a user clicks on the ads. This makes it unlikely that you could spend more than you intended to.

YouTube ads are also more targeted than any other form of advertising. You have a lot of options when choosing who you want to target including metrics such as demographics, topics, similar audiences, customer matches, life events, and more.

Since the ad is a video, it generates far more engagement than a text ad on any other platform. Even though it is an ad, the video is still a great way for your brand to connect with potential audiences.

## Types of Video Ads for YouTube

The following are the different types of YouTube ads that you can create;

****Video Discovery**

Video discover ads appear on the search page results and are usually composed of a thumbnail image and a few lines of text. They also have a very recognizable “Ad” in the box to let all users know that this is sponsored content.

****In-Stream Ads**

In-stream video ads can be skippable or non-skippable. Skippable in-stream video ads will often play for a minimum of 5 seconds before allowing the user to skip to the video content. Non-skippable in-stream video ads do not have the “skip” button and the user has to watch the video to the end.

****Pre-roll Ads**

A pre-roll ad is just an in-stream ad that is not skippable. It doesn’t give the user the option of skipping the app and they have to watch the entire ad before they can watch the video. The pre-roll video ad is usually 15 to 60 seconds long.

****Bumper Ads**

Bumper ads are tiny non-skippable 6-second ads that will play right before the video content loads. They can be an ideal way to promote an event or a new brand. Since they are only 6 seconds long, they can be very easy to make.
